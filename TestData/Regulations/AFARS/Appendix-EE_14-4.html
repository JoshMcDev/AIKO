list is not all-inclusive.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="p List2">1) <strong class="ph b">Nongovernmental Meeting or
Conference</strong>. Cardholders may use GPC to pay for food if the
cost of food is a non-separable portion of a registration or
attendance fee that covers attendance and meals. CH may also use
the GPC if food is necessary to obtain full benefit of the meeting
or conference (B-233807, Aug. 27, 1990). Criteria used in
determining if an agency may pay for food for an employee attending
a nongovernmental meeting or conference:</p>
        <p class="p List3">i. Meals and refreshments are incidental to the
meeting or conference,</p>
        <p class="p List3">ii. Attendance at the meal or when refreshments
are provided is important to ensure the employees’ full
participation in the meeting or conference, and</p>
        <p class="p List3">iii. The meal and refreshments are part of a
formal conference or meeting that includes not just the meal and
refreshments and, discussions or speeches that may take place when

Attending a Government-Sponsored Conference</strong>. Cardholders
may use the GPC if food is necessary to obtain full benefit of the
conference and the conference involves matters of topical interest
to multiple agencies and/or nongovernmental participants. Also,
without statutory authority to charge a fee and retain the
proceeds, the host agency may not charge a registration or other
fee to defray the costs of providing food (B-198471, May 1, 1980,
and B-288266, Jan. 27, 2003). Criteria used in determining if an
agency may pay for food for an employee attending a
government-sponsored meeting or conference:</p>

meeting or conference,</p>
        <p class="p List3">ii. Attendance at the meal or when refreshments
are provided is important to ensure the employees’ full
participation in the meeting or conference, and</p>
        <p class="p List3">iii. The meal and refreshments are part of a
formal conference or meeting that includes not just the meal and
refreshments and discussions or speeches that may take place when
the meal and refreshments are served, but also substantial
functions separate from when the food is served.</p>
        <p class="p List3">iv. In addition, the meeting or conference may not
be a routine meeting that involves the day-to-day operations of the
government.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) <strong class="ph b">Agency Hosting a Formal
Conference.</strong> Cardholders may use the GPC if the conference
includes registration, published substantive agenda, and scheduled
speakers; the food is a legitimate conference expense; and the
conference involves matters of topical interest to multiple
agencies and/or nongovernmental participants. Also, without
statutory authority to charge a fee and retain the proceeds, the
host agency may not charge a registration or other fee to defray
the costs of providing food (B-300826, March 3, 2005). Criteria
used in determining when an agency, as host, may pay for food at a
formal conference:</p>
        <p class="p List3">i. Meals and refreshments are incidental to the
formal conference,</p>
        <p class="p List3">ii. Attendance at the meal or when refreshments
are provided is important for the host agency to ensure
attendees’ full participation in essential discussions and
speeches concerning the purpose of the formal conference, and</p>
        <p class="p List3">iii. The meal and refreshments are part of a
formal conference that includes not just the meal and refreshments
and discussions or speeches that may take place when the meal and
refreshments are served, but also substantial functions separate
from when the food is served.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) <strong class="ph b">Light Refreshments at
Government-sponsored Conferences</strong>. The agency sponsoring
the conference may use the GPC to provide light refreshments on
breaks at Government-sponsored conferences only for Government
employees on travel orders (TDY status). Use of GPC to buy
refreshments for non-Government employees or for Government
employees not on travel orders is prohibited.</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) <strong class="ph b">Agency Hosting a Focus Group</strong>.
Cardholders may use the GPC if the focus group advances a specific
statutory mission; the participants are federal employees; and the
expenditure contributes materially to the achievement of the
specific statutory function (B-304718, Nov. 9, 2005).</p>
        <p class="p List2">6) <strong class="ph b">Routine Agency Meeting Held to Discuss
the Internal Day-to-Day Operations of the Government</strong>.
Cardholders may use GPC if the meeting is held at an outside
facility, and the cost of food is included, at no extra charge, in
the fee for the conference space (B-281063, Dec. 1, 1999).</p>
        <p class="p List2">7) <strong class="ph b">Training</strong>. Cardholders may use

to complete the training if they missed the meal.</p>
        <p class="p List2">8) <strong class="ph b">Award Ceremony</strong>. Cardholders
may use GPC if the recipients will be publicly recognized, and the
authorized agency official has determined that food advances the
recognition of the awardee. Sponsoring agency may serve light
refreshments at award ceremonies honoring individuals recognized
under a Civilian Employee Incentive Award Program. Use of GPC to
pay for refreshments at the following types of ceremonies is
prohibited: retirement, promotion, graduation, recurring quarterly
recognition, commanders’ call, PCS, and longevity (65 Comp.
Gen. 738 (1986)).</p>
        <p class="p List2">9) <strong class="ph b">Cultural Awareness Ceremony</strong>.
Cardholders may use GPC if the food is part of a formal program
intended to advance EEO objectives and make the audience aware of
the cultural or ethnic history being celebrated. The food must be a
sample of the food of the culture and be offered as part of the
larger program to serve an educational function (B-301184, Jan. 15,
2004).</p>
        <p class="p List2">10) <strong class="ph b">Official Representational Funds
(ORF).</strong> Cardholders may use the GPC to extend official
courtesies, including meals and refreshments, to authorized guests
in accordance with AR 37-47 or appropriate agency regulations. The
GPC must be dedicated solely for use of ORF expenditures. For
example, ORF may be used to purchase food in support of Employer

programs to assist members of the Armed Forces and their immediate
family members in building and maintaining strong family
structures. Allowable expenses include the cost of transportation,
food, lodging, supplies, fees, childcare, and training materials
for members of the Armed Forces and their immediate family members,
including participation at retreats and training conferences (10
USC 1789(b) and AR 165-1).</p>
        <p class="p List2">12) <strong class="ph b">Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program
(YRRP)</strong>. Use of the GPC may be authorized for purchases in
support of YRRP events (e.g., meals/refreshments, childcare) for
eligible individuals when the purchase is considered a
“necessary expense” in carrying out the statutory
requirement of the program established under Public Law 110-181
Section 582. See DoDI 1342.28; JTR 031902; 37 USC § 481l and
37 USC § 452(b)(15); OUSD Memo “Use of Appropriated
Funds for the YRRP” dated 7 Jul 2010; and Chief National
Guard Bureau Manual 1801.01.</p>
        <p class="p List2">13) <strong class="ph b">Recruiting Activities</strong>.
Cardholders may use the GPC for purchases in compliance with Army
Regulation (AR) 601-2, Army Recruiting Support Programs Chapter
5-2. See National Guard Regulation 601-1 para. 9-10., Army National
Guard Strength Maintenance Program. Per 10 USC <span class="ph" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_14-4__Hlk152936690"></span>§ 520c: Recruiting functions:
provisions of meals and refreshments, funds appropriated to the
Department of Defense for recruitment of military personnel may be

        <p class="p List2">14) <strong class="ph b">Field Studies Program (FSP)</strong>.
Cardholders may use the GPC for the Field Studies Program to pay
for administrative program costs and actual event execution costs
below the micro-purchase threshold. DoD training activities may pay
for expenditures in support of the Field Studies Program IAW DoDI
5410.17, AR 12-15, SECNAVINST 4950.4B, and AFI 16–105,
including but not limited to, food and meals, supplies for
International Military Student lounges such as coffee, tea, and
condiment kits, admission to authorized venues, rental of event
space, hiring of tour guides as well as other authorized support
services during FSP field trips. See AR 12-15, Chapter
11-30a(2).</p>
        <p class="p List2">15) <strong class="ph b">Emergency Requirements</strong>. CHs
may use the GPC to purchase food in emergency circumstances where
the provision of food is incidental to the protection of human life
or Federal property (B-189003, July 5, 1977). This exception
applies in authorized emergency conditions that clearly present an
imminent danger to human life and/or destruction to federal
property and it was necessary to have employees assist in the
emergency response and/or maintain the essential functions of the
office for an extended period (53 Comp. Gen. 71 (1973) and
B189003). Emergency circumstances do not include situations where
employees are merely required to remain on duty beyond their
regular working hours, even if required to remain on duty for a
24-hour period (B-185159, Dec. 10, 1975). Further, emergency
circumstances do not include situations merely involving inclement
weather (68 Comp. Gen. 46 (1988)). Food is unauthorized in an event
where personnel were not engaged in activities to prevent imminent
danger to human life or Federal property but were only
investigating a dangerous situation which had already occurred.
Food purchases for this exception will depend on the facts and
circumstances present in each case. Occupations such as those of
policeman, firemen, security guards, are often required to be
performed under emergent and dangerous conditions and this fact
alone does not warrant departure from general rule against payment
for employees' meals from appropriated funds (B-185159, December
10, 1975).</p>
        <p class="p List1">h. <strong class="ph b">Fuel.</strong>

donor program where nonappropriated funds are permitted. Gift Fund
purchases must each have a supporting legal review uploaded in the
bank’s EAS. Gift Fund programs must operate in accordance
with AR 1-100 and donor intent while following their local Gift
Fund standard operating procedure. The A/OPC will check uploaded
purchase documents to ensure the supporting legal review is

in Kind (SIK).</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="p List2">1) The GPC is the preferred method to purchase and
pay for LIK/SIK requirements below the MPT on dedicated LIK/SIK
cards.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) The requiring activity must coordinate LIK/SIK
requirements with their respective contracting activities early in
the acquisition planning process to decide if a contract or the GPC
is the appropriate method of procurement. The requiring
activity’s contracting office will determine the proper
procurement method. If the GPC is deemed the appropriate
procurement method, the contracting office will forward the
requirement to the appropriate CH to make the purchase. If the
appropriate procurement method is determined to be a contract or
BPA, the contracting office should establish or utilize a
contract/BPA. The contracting office will determine if the GPC will
be used as a method of payment.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) The Army will identify recurring GPC LIK/SIK
requirements on an annual basis and, where appropriate, put these
acquisitions into contract vehicles or BPAs.</p>

or funds otherwise available to the agency to pay for expenses for
employees to obtain professional credentials, including expenses
for professional accreditation, state-imposed and professional
licenses, and professional certification; and examinations to
obtain such credentials. The authority under subsection</p>
        <p class="p">(a) may not be exercised on behalf of any employee occupying or
seeking to qualify for appointment to any position that is excepted
from the competitive service because of the confidential, policy-
determining, policymaking, or policy-advocating character of the
position.</p>
        <p class="p List1">m. <strong class="ph b">Recreational Events</strong>.

or a statement that reflects the beginning and ending date of the
subscription service. CHs must purchase mission-related
subscriptions to magazines, journals, and technical data in the
name of the agency only rather than in the name of an individual
employee. Advance payments are authorized for subscriptions to
prevent disruptions in service. Subscriptions must not have an
automatic renewal at the end of the subscription period. Before
leaving their role, CHs should notify their BO and A/OPC so that
the subscription may be cancelled or transferred to another account
as appropriate.</p>
        <p class="p List1">o. <strong class="ph b">Tires</strong>. Cardholders may use <a class="xref" href="https://www.dla.mil/Land-and-Maritime/Business/Selling/Global-Tires-Program/" target="_blank">FedMall’s

        <p class="p List1">p. <strong class="ph b">Travel Advances, Claims, or
Expenses</strong>. Only the Government Travel Charge Card is to be
used for individual official travel-related expenses. All
travel-related expenses (e.g., metro fares, taxi, bus fares,
automated toll tools, and parking fees) are processed in accordance
with the JTR. For travel-related expenses, the GPC may be used only
to place orders and/or make payments against contracts awarded by
warranted Contracting Officers.</p>
        <p class="p List1">q. <strong class="ph b">Vehicle-related expenses.</strong>
These expenses are generally paid with the travel or fleet cards.
CHs may use GPC when the travel or fleet card is inappropriate,

Components with weapons, ammunition, explosives, and other
commodities listed in DFARS PGI 208.7006. DoD Components are to
submit their commodity requirements via MIPR to the assigned
Component in accordance with DFARS 208.7002 and DFARS PGI
208.7002-1. See Chapter 16 for exceptions to policy. CHs may
