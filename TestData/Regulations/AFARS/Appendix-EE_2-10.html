      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. Separation of duties is an internal control
activity intended to provide checks and balances to the GPC process
and to prevent or minimize innocent errors or intentional fraud
occurring without detection. This internal control ensures that no
single individual has control over multiple phases of a purchase
card transaction. To protect the integrity of the procurement
process, no one person is responsible for an entire purchase card
transaction. OMB standards for internal controls require that key
duties and responsibilities be divided or segregated among
individuals to ensure they do not exceed or abuse their assigned
authority. See OMB Circular A-123, Appendix B Revised, paragraph
4.3. To the greatest extent possible, GPC duties will be assigned
to different individuals within the GPC hierarchical structure. As
stated in the DoD FMR, “separation of duties precludes errors
or attempts at fraud or embezzlement from going undetected.
Internal controls generally require a four-way separation of the
contracting, receiving/[accepting], voucher certification, and
disbursing functions.”</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. Key GPC duties include making purchases and/or
payments (CHs); verifying purchases and/or payments are proper
(BOs, Certifying Officers, and FSOs); certifying invoices for
payment (BOs, Certifying Officers, and FSOs); certifying
availability of funds (Financial RMs); receiving and accepting
supplies and services, including independent receipt and acceptance
(acceptors); disbursing funds (Disbursing Office); and conducting
policy, review, and audit functions (A/OPCs and Property Book
Officers). For example:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) BOs will not be CHs under their own MAs.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) RMs will not be CHs or BOs with responsibility
for executing their own funds.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Accountable Property Officers or their
equivalents will not be CHs with authority to purchase accountable
items (this does not apply to Property Book Hand Receipt
Holders).</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Purchases of accountable (e.g., pilferable)
property, and self-generated purchases, will have acceptance
performed by someone other than the CH, BO, and Certifying
Officer.</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) CAC-enabled systems will generate a
conflict-of-interest report to depict instances where assigned
roles do not conform to DoD policy.</p>
        <p class="p List2">6) Authorization roles will be assigned to a
user’s profile, with each profile allowing only that
individual the ability to perform specific tasks in the system.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. If resource constraints prevent assignment of
the key duties to different individuals, as set forth in paragraph
a. above, the activity must request a waiver through the Level 4
A/OPC and the CCO to the Level 3 A/OPC for approval.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. Notwithstanding the above-described waiver
process, certain key duties must not be assigned to the same
individual. In no case will the same individual be both the CH and
BO for a GPC account. In no case will the Accountable Property
Officer or A/OPC (primary or alternate) also be a CH, BO or
contracting officer making contract payments with a GPC or
executing GPC purchases. A CH who is a hand receipt holder should
not purchase property for their own use. The servicing bank
provides the functionality to generate a report identifying
potential conflicts of interest in GPC program duties.</p>
