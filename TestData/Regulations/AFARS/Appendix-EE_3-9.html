valued less than the MPT will not be reported to FPDS. See <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/4.606" target="_blank">FAR 4.606(c)</a> for a
list of additional actions that are not to be reported.</p>

contract or order where the GPC is used solely as the method of
payment will be reported to FPDS individually regardless of dollar

actions (i.e., order not under a federal contract or agreement)
purchased and paid for using the GPC will not be reported to FPDS,
except in accordance with FAR 4.606(a)(2). As a reminder, the GPC
may only be used for open market actions when the value of the
action is under or equal to the micro-purchase threshold as defined
in FAR 2.101.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Contract Orders</strong>. Contracting
offices will ensure all orders made by Contract Ordering Official
CHs are reported to FPDS, regardless of value, no less frequently
than monthly as required in DFARS PGI 204.606. For order actions
under federally awarded contracts (e.g., schedules, governmentwide
acquisition contracts, indefinite delivery contracts), blanket
purchase agreements, and basic ordering agreements:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Report all actions purchased and paid for using
the GPC to FPDS.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Report all actions valued $25,000 or more
individually; express reporting processes will not be used.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Report the actions valued less than $25,000 in
the following descending order of preference:</p>
        <p class="p List3">i. Individually, not using express reporting
procedures.</p>
        <p class="p List3">ii. Using express reporting procedures that
compile all actions monthly under the identified existing
contract/agreement (such as a specific schedule) and vendor.</p>
        <p class="p List3">iii. Using express reporting procedures that
compile all actions monthly without specifically identifying the
existing contract/agreement and vendor. Only use this alternative
when the first two choices are determined to be overly burdensome
by the HCA. When used, identify the vendor using the generic Unique
Entity ID (UEI) number for either domestic or foreign GPC
consolidated reporting. See GPC one-pager, <a class="xref" href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/asda/dpc/ce/pc/docs/training/3OP039_UEIs-for-GPC-Reporting.pptx" target="_blank">Unique

          </a> states the GSA Office of Charge Card Management
will provide the GPC data at a minimum annually, and GSA will
incorporate that data into FPDS for reports. This does not result
in duplicative FPDS reporting of GPC transactions, as GSA has
confirmed it reports only high-level data (i.e., total numbers of
transactions and dollars) outside the FPDS database. FPDS-NG
access, training, and instruction manuals are available on
FPDS.gov.</p>
