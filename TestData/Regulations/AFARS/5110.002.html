Specific requirements pertaining to market research in support of other than full and open competition are included in AFARS

      <p class="p">Contracting officers are reminded to consider the use of pre-existing contracts to fulfill requirements for supplies or services, before awarding new contracts. Contracting officers should ensure the results of the market research justify the basis for the decision to initiate a new standalone contract when a preexisting contract is available, and that the decision is documented in the written acquisition plan in accordance with FAR 7.10; DFARS 207.1; and AFARS <a class="xref 5107.1 fm:Subpart" href="Subpart_5107.1.html#AFARS_Subpart_5107.1">subpart&nbsp; 5107.1</a> and the acquisition strategy for services in accordance with <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="5137.5906.html">5137.590-6 Acquisition strategy content.</a>. </p>
