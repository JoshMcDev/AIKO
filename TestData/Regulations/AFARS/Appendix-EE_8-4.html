        <p class="p">This category describes training in which the vendor is making
the course content and/or materials to be specific to the
requesting agency. Tailored training typically requires a detailed
Statement of Work (SOW) and review/acceptance of deliverable. The
following are indicators of tailored training:</p>
        <p class="p"></p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Creating a new training course. </p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Changing the content of an existing course to
make it agency-specific. </p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Adding terms and conditions to a regularly
scheduled, COTS training event. </p>
        <p class="p"></p>
        <p class="p">b.</p>
        <p class="p">If the Government has a need for tailored training or tailored
training materials, the requirement must be forwarded to the
contracting office for procurement. (See DoDI 1400.25, Volume
410</p>
        <p class="p">.</p>
