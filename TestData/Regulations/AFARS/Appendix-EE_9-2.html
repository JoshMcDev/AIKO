      <p class="p List1">b. When following priorities for use of mandatory

supply is not comparable to supplies available from the private
sector that best meet the Government’s needs in terms of
price, quality, and time of delivery (FAR 8.602(a)(1)); and the
item is acquired in accordance with FAR 8.602(a)(4). Cardholders
should work with their supporting contracting office to make this

performance.</p>
