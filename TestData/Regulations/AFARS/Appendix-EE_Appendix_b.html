        <strong class="ph b">AbilityOne Program</strong> - FAR Subpart 8.7 - This
socioeconomic program provides employment opportunities for over
40,000 Americans who are blind or have other severe disabilities by
orchestrating Government purchases of products and services
provided by nonprofit agencies employing such individuals
throughout the country. The Committee for Purchase from People Who
Are Blind or Severely Disabled statute, (41 USC 8501-8506) requires
the Government to purchase supplies or services on the Procurement
List, at prices established by the Committee, from AbilityOne
participating nonprofit agencies if they are available within the
period required.</p>

Intentional.</p>
      <p class="p">
        <strong class="ph b">Accountable Property</strong> - AR 735-5 - A term used
to identify property recorded in a formal property management or
accounting system. Accountable property includes all property
purchased, leased (capital leases), or otherwise obtained having a
unit acquisition cost of $5,000 or more (land, regardless of cost),
and items that are sensitive. Sensitive items require a high degree
of protection and control due to statutory requirements or
regulations, such as narcotics and drug abuse items; precious
metals; items which are of a high value, highly technical, or a
hazardous nature; and small arms, ammunition, explosives, and
demolition material or classified. (See Volume 10, Table 61 of DoD
4100.39-M reference (k).) Additional and/or separate records or
other record-keeping instruments will be established for management
purposes, or when otherwise required by law, policy, regulation, or
agency direction, including, but not limited to pilferable items.
Pilferable items have a ready resale value or application to
personal possession and are, therefore, especially subject to
theft. Screening by the Accountable Property Officer (APO) is
required to determine the accounting requirements of the purchased
property. The installation APO provides guidance on specific local
property accountability procedures to the A/OPC, BOs, and CHs
related to GPC purchases.</p>

      <p class="p">
        <strong class="ph b">Pre-Purchase Approval</strong> - When required and
identified by Army or local procedures, documentation showing
authority has been obtained to purchase special-use items such as

      <p class="p">

        <strong class="ph b">Receipt</strong> - A receipt is a written record of a
transaction documenting proof of payment. The receipt acts as the
title to the property obtained in the exchange. A receipt is a
legal document which serves as a permanent record of the
transaction that can be used to support financial records (i.e.,
billing official invoice). Internet shopping has led to the
creation of <a class="xref" href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-electronic-cash.htm" target="_blank">electronic</a>
receipts. Many online businesses provide the cardholder with the
option of printing a receipt of the transaction as soon as the
payment is approved. In addition, the vendor may provide the
cardholder with an <a class="xref" href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-email.htm" target="_blank">email</a> copy of
the receipt. The receipt includes basic information about the
nature of the sale. This essential detail includes the date of the
transaction, a list of the prices of the items purchased, subtotal,
applicable taxes, and a final total.</p>
      <p class="p">Some receipts will provide unit prices and extended prices when
multiple units of the same item are purchased, as well as a
detailed description of each item.</p>
      <p class="p">

and establishes lines of accounting used on the GPC program. The RM
is responsible for the proper assignment of funding on an
obligation document before the obligation is incurred, and for
maintaining a system of positive funds control.</p>
      <p class="p">
        <strong class="ph b">Split Purchase</strong> - Occurs when a CH splits a
known requirement at the time of the purchase into several
transactions to circumvent dollar thresholds in order to use the
GPC; to avoid competitive bids for purchases over the MPT; or to
avoid other established credit limits (this is prohibited). When a
known small purchase requirement exceeds the MPT, it must be
purchased through a contract using simplified acquisition
procedures.</p>
      <p class="p">
        <strong class="ph b">Third-party Payments</strong> – An online payment
processor (e.g., PayPal, Square) provides ways for a merchant to
accept credit cards and other payments online without the extra
cost and obligation of a merchant account. Where it is identified
that a purchase will be processed via a third-party merchant (i.e.
PayPal), the CH should make every attempt to choose another
merchant with whom to procure the goods and/or services. If still
found necessary to procure using a third-party payment merchant,
the CH and BO must ensure there is adequate supporting
documentation to prove that there was a detailed review of the
purchase and that the use of the third-party payment merchant was
unavoidable.</p>
      <p class="p">Transactions made with a third-party payment merchant are
considered high risk for both subsequent audit and data mining
screening.</p>
      <p class="p">
        <strong class="ph b">Third-Party E-Commerce Merchants</strong> –
Third-party merchants are entities that fulfill orders on e-
commerce platforms who are NOT the platform providers themselves.
These individual merchants might offer products for sale on various
online marketplaces, such as AmazonBusiness.com.</p>
      <p class="p">
        <strong class="ph b">Third-Party Payment Processors</strong> –
Commercial financial service providers offering on-line payment
solutions for commercial transactions. These processors own
merchant accounts that allow them to accept and process purchase
card payments on behalf of merchants who provide supplies and
services. Many merchants choose to utilize third party payment
processors to accept payments without having to establish a
merchant account through a merchant bank. Examples include PayPal,
Venmo, or Square.</p>
      <p class="p">
        <strong class="ph b">Training – Commercial Off-the-Shelf
