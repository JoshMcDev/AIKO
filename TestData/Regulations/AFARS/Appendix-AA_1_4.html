Team Roles &amp; Responsibilities</h1>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">Source selection is a multi-disciplined team effort. The Source
Selection Team (SST) should include representatives from
appropriate functional areas such as contracting, small business,
technical, logistics, cost/price, legal, and program management.
User organizations should also be represented.</p>
      <p class="p">The success of any source selection is usually determined by the
personnel involved at all levels, and their degree of active
participation. Likewise, the Source Selection Authority (SSA), with
assistance from the SCO, will ensure the appointment of personnel
with the requisite skills, expertise, and experience to ensure the
success of the source selection, to include members appointed to
the Source Selection Advisory Council (SSAC).</p>
      <p class="p">The SCO is responsible for determining the capability of the
organization to effectively resource the SST as set forth in the
hierarchy of source selection expertise below (See Figure 1-1). In
the event the SCO determines the required expertise is not
obtainable, the HCA will be consulted. If the HCA concurs the
appropriate resources are still unavailable, the DASA(P) will be
notified and will assist in providing resources from other
contracting activities or assign the procurement to another
contracting activity for execution.</p>

          <em class="ph i">Figure 1-1: Hierarchy of Source Selection Expertise</em>
        </p>
      <p class="p">The size and composition of the SST will vary depending upon the
requirements of each acquisition. For example, major hardware
acquisitions frequently involve requirements impacting various
organizations from across the Army (or from other services on
joint-service programs). In such cases, and when forming the SST,
SSEB Factor/Subfactor teams should include evaluator representation
from each major requirements organization. These evaluators should
be assigned to the evaluation criteria associated with their
specific area of requirements and expertise. Inclusion of technical
evaluators who are subject matter experts on the requirement(s)
being evaluated is essential to a successful evaluation process
providing fair/accurate assessment of the proposals, and absolutely
critical where joint-service and/or multiple functional
requirements are involved.</p>
      <p class="p">Whether the team is large or small, it should be structured to
ensure teamwork, unity of purpose, and allow for appropriate open
communication among the team members throughout the process. This
will facilitate a comprehensive evaluation and selection of the
best value proposal.</p>

      <p class="p">For source selections with a total estimated value of $100M or
more, the SST shall consist of the SSA, a SSAC, and an SSEB. Each
of these SST entities has distinct and separate functions (See
Figure 1-2).</p>

          <strong class="ph b">NOTE</strong>: Source selections using LPTA methodology
do NOT require the SSAC or require a SSAC Report be prepared.</p>
      <p class="p">The SSEB is usually comprised of multiple groups of evaluators
who are responsible for evaluating specific areas of the proposal
against the RFP requirements. Additionally, legal counsel, small
business professionals, cost/price, and technical experts may also
serve as SST advisors. The precise structure of the SSEB is a
matter within the SSA’s discretion.</p>
