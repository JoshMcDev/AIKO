        <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-1___1-1._Overview">a. The Army Federal
Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFARS) Appendix EE provides
policy guidance and procedures for the management of the Army
Government Purchase Card (GPC) program. It implements and
supplements sections of the Department of Defense (DoD) Government
Charge Card Guidebook for Establishing and Managing Purchase,
Travel, and Fuel Card Programs (hereinafter referred to as the DoD
Charge Card Guidebook). In the event of a conflict between DoD
policy and Army policy, DoD policy takes precedence. In the event
of a conflict between Army policy and command policy, Army policy
takes precedence over any less-restrictive command policy. These
operating procedures neither supersede nor take precedence over
more-restrictive Army command procedures. This document applies to
all purchases utilizing Army-issued GPCs.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. Refer recommended changes and questions about
the AFARS Appendix EE to the Office of the Deputy Assistant
Secretary of the Army (Procurement) (ODASA(P)). Submit requests for
waivers through the chain of command. Compliance with the AFARS
Appendix EE is mandatory.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. The GPC program provides Army and supported
organizations a simplified, streamlined method of purchasing and
paying for supplies, services, construction projects, and contract
payments. The program complies with Federal, DoD, and Army
statutory and regulatory guidance, as well as the terms and
conditions specified in the most current General Services
Administration (GSA) SmartPay® 3 Master Contract. The primary
benefit of the GPC Program is that the card-issuing banks provide a
commercial purchase and payment service that replaces the
paper-based, time-consuming purchase order process; reduces
procurement lead time; provides transaction cost savings; reduces
procurement office workload; provides refunds; and facilitates
payment to include reductions in interest payments.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. The AFARS Appendix EE provides the procedures
to use within the Army, including Army National Guard (ARNG) and
Air National Guard (ANG), to establish and manage the Army GPC
program. Army activities may supplement (i.e., adopt more stringent
internal control requirements than the requirements cited herein),
but not change this policy. However, as these are risk-managed
programs, activities should maintain a proper balance between the
control environment and ease of use to ensure that the benefits of
the card continue to accrue. These procedures establish Army-wide
standards designed to provide all Army activities with a foundation
upon which to build specific standard operating procedures
governing their programs.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. Nonappropriated Fund (NAF) activities implement
policies and procedures governing the Army’s Morale, Welfare,
and Recreation programs and regulations for Nonappropriated Fund
Instrumentalities (NAFI). Chaplaincy activities implement policies
and procedures governing Army Chaplain Corps activities. Army
NAFIs/entities must operate within the parameters of these
procedures to include Public Health Command (PHC) NAFIs, Department
of Defense Education Activities (DoDEA) NAFIs, and Army National
Guard NAFIs. NAF activities will comply with the Department of
Defense Policies and Procedures Governing Non-Appropriated Funds
SmartPay® 3 Government-wide Commercial Purchase Card Use
– SP3 Transition Memorandum #11. Non-appropriated funds
(NAF)-funded GPCs issued under SmartPay3 must be properly
segregated for oversight. All NAF GPC Cardholder (CH) accounts must
be established under separate managing accounts (MAs). Commingling
of appropriated and non-appropriated funded cards under a single MA
is strictly prohibited.</p>
