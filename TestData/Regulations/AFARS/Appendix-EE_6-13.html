      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. GPC transaction documentation must be retained
for six years in accordance with FAR 4.805. Billing officials are
responsible for ensuring that record retention requirements are
met. GPC transactions with foreign military sales (FMS) funding
must follow the retention guidance in DoD FMR Volume 15, Chapter 6,
and ensure the FMS documents are retained for 10 years from the
date of final case closure.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Uploading Supporting
Documentation</strong>. CHs must upload all transaction supporting
documentation in the bank’s EAS. The uploaded documentation
is the CH’s official purchase file. If the complete file is
uploaded in the EAS, CHs do not need to maintain a duplicate
hardcopy or electronic file. For purchases that do not have
uploaded documentation, the CH or BO must retain the corresponding
hardcopy or electronic files for six years.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Corrective Action</strong>. When
documentation is not retained in accordance with the GPC file
retention policy, A/OPCs must evaluate the CH/BO’s record
retention processes and develop corrective action plans with target
completion dates to prevent recurrence.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Storage, Handling, and Contract files
(FAR 4.805)</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Procedures for the handling, storing, and
disposing of contract files must be in accordance with the National
Archives and Records Administration (NARA) General Records Schedule
1.1, Financial Management and Reporting Records.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) The Financial Management and Reporting Records
can be found at <a class="xref" href="http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/grs.html" target="_blank">http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/grs.html</a>.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Procedures must consider documents held in all
types of media, including microfilm and various electronic
media.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) The Army may change the original medium to
facilitate storage if the requirements of the FAR 4.8, law, and
other regulations are satisfied.</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) The process used to create and store records
must record and reproduce the original document, including
signatures and other written and graphic images completely,
accurately, and clearly.</p>
        <p class="p List2">6) Data transfer, storage, and retrieval
procedures must protect the original data from alteration. Unless
law or other regulations require signed originals to be kept, they
may be destroyed after the responsible agency official verifies
that record copies on alternate media and copies reproduced from
the record copy are accurate, complete, and clear representations
of the originals.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. Original disbursing office records, along with
CH supporting documents in electronic format, negate the need for
the CH to store duplicate hardcopy documents.</p>
        <p class="p List1">f. Electronic record storage requires adequate
controls to ensure the digital images accurately represent the
corresponding paper documentation and to detect changes to an
original digital image. In addition, electronic storage must be in
a centrally managed location that has an established backup
process.</p>
        <p class="p List1">g. See 6-2.g. for GPC transaction documentation
and disbursing office records. For additional examples of documents
classified as disbursing office records, see DoD FMR Volume 5,
Chapter 15, 150803.</p>
        <p class="p List1">h. Receipts are considered supporting documents
for the certified billing statement. Original receipts are
preferred; however, printed electronic forms or copies of an
itemized receipt are acceptable. The receipt must be legible and
indicate vendor’s name and address, date of the purchase, and
paid by credit card or zero amount due. Goods must be
itemized/detailed with the item description, quantity, price, and
extended price. The BO maintains these records electronically. The
CH and BO may rely on the servicing bank’s EAS for supporting
documentation. Original records are considered Government property
and may not be removed from Government control by the BO for any
reason.</p>
        <p class="p List1">i. <strong class="ph b">Appointment Letters</strong>.
Delegation of authority letters and GPC appointment letters,
executed by both the appointer and the appointee, will be retained
in PIEE/JAM for six years after the delegation has been terminated
through personnel action such as the appointee’s separation,
retirement, or transfer.</p>
        <p class="p List1">j. A/OPCs must retain any paper-based or email
requests relating to new account issuance and maintenance for six
years after the date of account issuance or update.</p>
        <p class="p List1">k. Data residing in the bank’s EAS is
maintained by the bank for six years. Reports may be retrieved from
the bank’s EAS for the previous two years. Reports covering
data for periods beyond the previous two years are available from
