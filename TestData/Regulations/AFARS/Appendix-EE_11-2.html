Process</h1>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. Surveillance and oversight of the GPC program
are a shared responsibility. All stakeholders in the program,
including requiring offices, RMs, logistics, contracting, and local
audit and oversight organizations, are responsible for ensuring
that the GPC is used in the proper manner and only authorized and
necessary official purchases are made. Organizations should develop
and follow a monitoring and oversight plan that establishes
frequencies, methods, participation, etc.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. Oversight is conducted to:</p>
      <p class="p List2">1) Validate and promote compliance with existing
internal controls;</p>
      <p class="p List2">2) Identify, report, and resolve systemic material
program weaknesses; and</p>
      <p class="p List2">3) Measure the effectiveness of internal
controls.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. To improve auditability of GPC program
oversight and realize the cost and other benefits of using the
commercially available SP3 technology, DoD uses the integrated
three-pronged, system-enabled review cycle depicted in Figure
11-1.</p>
      <p class="p" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_11-2__Toc174981137">Figure 11-1: Three-Pronged Oversight
Review Cycle</p>
      <p class="p"> 
         <img class="image" src="Graphics/image3.png" alt="Text Description automatically generated"> 
      </p>
      <p class="p List1">d. The three-pronged review cycle supplements
existing GPC operational transaction management and account
reconciliation and review processes, including:</p>
      <p class="p List2">1) Cardholder-obtained purchasing approvals (e.g.,
BO pre-purchase approval, special item approval, availability of
appropriate and sufficient funds);</p>
      <p class="p List2">2) Cardholder matching and approval of orders to
transactions and monthly statement approval;</p>
      <p class="p List2">3) Billing official monthly certification of the
managing account billing statement;</p>
      <p class="p List2">4) Resource manager funds certification;</p>
      <p class="p List2">5) A/OPC ongoing oversight and policy compliance
efforts; and</p>
      <p class="p List2">6) Disbursing office funds validation and
disbursement processing.</p>
      <p class="p">The cycle also supplements and informs both the periodic reviews
of Army contracting offices (e.g., Army PMRs or DCMA-led PMRs)
conducted to assess the effectiveness of the contracting function,
and the GPC governance processes conducted to evaluate and improve
the effectiveness of GPC internal controls.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Data analytics.</strong> Data analytics
is the application of electronic tools (software and/or systems)
for automated data sorting, filtering and mining techniques using
self-learning algorithms to search GPC transaction data in order to
identify patterns, trends, risks, opportunities and other
information. A/OPCs should use data analytics tools to assist them
in the management and oversight of their GPC program.</p>
      <p class="p List1">f. The Army uses preventive, detective, and
directive controls to monitor the GPC program.</p>
      <p class="p List2">1) Preventive controls are designed to discourage
errors or irregularities from occurring (e.g., processing a
transaction only after it has been properly approved by the
appropriate personnel).</p>
      <p class="p List2">2) Detective controls are designed to find errors
or irregularities after they have occurred (e.g., IOD data mining,
approving statements, and reconciling monthly invoices).</p>
      <p class="p List2">3) Directive controls are designed to encourage a
desirable event (e.g., written policies and procedures to assist in
compliance and the accomplishment of the goals and objectives of
the GPC program).</p>
      <p class="p List1">g. The HCA/SCO and A/OPCs are responsible for
adhering to the requirements specified in OMB Circular A-123,
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Control. The HCA/SCO
and A/OPCs are also responsible for adhering to the requirements
specified in 10 USC 4754 (as modified by Public Law 112–194,
Government Charge Card Abuse Prevention Act of 2012). These
statutory requirements mandate the following actions (list not
comprehensive):</p>
      <p class="p List2">1) Using effective systems, techniques, and
technologies to prevent or identify improper purchases.</p>
      <p class="p List2">2) Invalidating GPCs from each employee who ceases
to be employed by the Government or separates from Military
Service.</p>
      <p class="p List2">3) Taking steps to recover the cost of any
illegal, improper, or erroneous purchases made with a purchase card
or convenience check made by an employee or member of the armed
forces, including, as necessary, through salary offsets.</p>
      <p class="p List2">4) Taking appropriate adverse personnel actions or
imposing other punishments when employees of the Army violate
regulations governing the use and control of purchase cards and
convenience checks or who are negligent or engage in misuse, abuse,
or fraud with respect to a purchase card, including removal in
appropriate cases. Violations of such regulations by a person
subject to 10 USC Chapter 47, the Uniform Code of Military Justice
(UCMJ), is punishable as a violation of section 892 of article 92
of the UCMJ.</p>
      <p class="p List2">5) Requiring the Army Audit Agency to conduct
periodic audits or reviews of GPC programs to identify and analyze
risks of illegal, improper, or erroneous purchases and payments and
report the result to the Director of the OMB and Congress.</p>
      <p class="p List2">6) A/OPCs must provide monitoring, oversight,
training, and administration of all BOs and CHs. Supervisors and
BOs are responsible for the monitoring and oversight of BOs and CHs
under their purview.</p>
      <p class="p List1">h. To minimize losses to the Army, the program
must have an expectation of high integrity and ethical behavior
from all participants, and sufficient staff to perform the
following functions:</p>
      <p class="p List2">1) Conduct periodic risk assessments to identify
fraud, waste, and abuse and establish specific controls to
reasonably ensure that losses from these risks are minimized, to
include data mining.</p>
      <p class="p List2">2) Conduct proper training and complete reporting
and data analysis to ensure personnel have the skills and
information needed to be effective in their positions.</p>
      <p class="p List2">3) Conduct detailed, effective management and
oversight.</p>
      <p class="p List2">4) Implement corrective actions when cardholder
management is non-compliant with Army policies and procedures.</p>
      <p class="p List1">i. DPCAP will rely on the signed Semi-Annual HA
data provided by CPMs to accomplish DoD GPC reporting required by
OMB. DPCAP updates visual trending of statistical and violation
information to identify trends in GPC use and variances and shares
this information with the Army during the GPC CPM Monthly
Calls.</p>
      <p class="p List1">j. The GPC Integrated Solutions Team (IST) is
DoD’s GPC governance body. IST membership consists of a GPC
Governance Board composed of representatives from DPCAP, Army,
Navy, Air Force, other Defense agencies, and supported by the bank
team. The bank team consists of U.S. Bank (card-issuing bank),
MasterCard (card association), and Oversight Systems (data mining
vendor). The IST typically meets semi-annually to achieve the
following:</p>
      <p class="p List2">1) Review trends and changes in the GPC industry
and the DoD GPC Program.</p>
      <p class="p List2">2) Identify and approve any necessary adjustments
to the bank team's electronic capabilities, DoD’s GPC
enterprise tools, and/or DoD GPC policies.</p>
      <p class="p List2">3) Identify and approve changes to the DM rules
and system parameter settings.</p>
      <p class="p List2">4) Bring efficiencies to the Program by adjusting
the business rules/parameters based on transaction risk.</p>
      <p class="p List2">5) Review trends and changes in the GPC industry
and the DoD GPC Program.</p>
      <p class="p List2">6) Identify any necessary adjustments to the bank
team's electronic capabilities, DoD’s GPC enterprise tools,
and/or DoD GPC policies.</p>
      <p class="p List2">7) Identify and approving changes to the Data
Mining rules.</p>
      <p class="p List2">8) Review relevant data mining case information
and recommendations provided by the bank team (e.g., percentage of
data mining cases created for review; frequency with which each
rule is triggered and associated DM case disposition, and
information about the findings, determinations, and corrective
actions identified) and results of the Semi-Annual HA process to
inform its decision making.</p>
