      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. GPC programs require procurement authority to
operate and cannot be established or maintained unless procurement
authority is granted in accordance with governing laws and
regulations and delegated through a contracting activity identified
in Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS)
Procedures, Guidance, and Information (PGI) 202.101 and the DoD
Charge Card Guidebook. Contracting authority flows from authorities
granted in Titles 10 and 41, United States Code (10 and 41 USC)
from DoD to the Secretary of the Army to the Heads of Contracting
Activities (HCAs). The HCA re- delegates contracting authority to
local procurement offices. The Senior Contracting Official (SCO) or
Chief of Contracting Office (CCO) may re-delegate their GPC
procurement authority listed in Table 1-3 to OA/OPCs or A/OPCs for
OA/OPCs and A/OPCs to appoint cardholders and convenience check
account holders through the Delegation of Contracting Authority
Letter produced in the Joint Appointment Module (JAM) within the <a class="xref" href="https://piee.eb.mil/xhtml/unauth/home/login.xhtml" target="_blank">
            <u class="ph u">Procurement
Integrated Enterprise Environment (PIEE)</u>.</a> See sections 1-8
and 5-1 for more information. Cardholders must countersign to
acknowledge this responsibility.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. The Joint Appointment Module (JAM), an
application within PIEE, is the mandatory enterprise tool for
appointing and delegating authority to GPC personnel.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. Orientation and training are prerequisites to
receiving GPC delegated authority via an appointment in JAM.
Training requirements are listed in Chapter 4.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. Generally, only a government employee can be a
cardholder or billing official. National Guard traditional members
and State employees should not be CHs or BOs. The following
exceptions apply:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Foreign nationals may be appointed as CHs only
if they are direct-hires working for the U.S. Government. However,
commanders/directors should consider the potential consequences of
appointing foreign nationals as CHs in countries where Status of
Forces Agreements (SOFAs) or local laws do not subject the foreign
national employee to the same pecuniary or general financial
liability or disciplinary actions for charge card violation as U.S.
citizens.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC)
instructors are members of the Armed Forces in accordance with
USACC Regulation 145-2, section 4-2, and may be designated micro-
purchase procurement authority as GPC cardholders. See FAR
1.603-3(b).</p>
