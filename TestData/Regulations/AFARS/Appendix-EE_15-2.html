        <p class="p">FAR 32.1108 and 32.1110(d) provide instructions for use of the
appropriate clause when payment under a written contract is made by
GPC. When using the GPC for contract payments, the contracting
officer</p>
        <p class="p">will insert the FAR clause 52.232-36, Payment by Third Party, in
solicitations and contracts. Payment by a purchase card may also be
made under a contract that does not contain the clause at
52.232-36, to the extent the contractor agrees to accept that
method of payment. When the clause at 52.232-36 is included in a
solicitation or contract, the contracting officer will also insert
the clause at 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds
Transfer—Central Contractor Registration, or 52.232-34,
Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer—Other Than Central
Contractor Registration, as appropriate. The contracting officer
should also insert DFARS clause 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission
of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports.</p>
