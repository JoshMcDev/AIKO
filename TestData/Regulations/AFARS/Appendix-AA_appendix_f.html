      <p class="p">Small Business Participation Commitment Document (SBPCD) (Sample Format)</p>
      <p class="p">The SBPCD format is designed to streamline and bring uniformity to responses and evaluations for small business participation when required under FAR 15.304. The format is distinctly different than the small business subcontracting plan required for other than small businesses (FAR 52.219-9). Proposals addressing the extent of small business participation (SBPCDs) shall be submitted separately from small business subcontracting plans (DFARS 215.305(c)(i)(B). A copy of the SBPCD is recommended to be provided in your instructions to offerors or as an attachment to the RFP.</p>
      <p class="p"> 
         <strong class="ph b">Other than small businesses</strong> are required to complete a SBPCD which will be incorporated into the resulting award by reference or attachment as an enforceable contractual requirement. Offerors should propose the level of participation of small businesses (as a small business prime, joint venture, teaming arrangement, and/or small business subcontractors) in the performance of the acquisition relative to the objectives/goals set forth in the evaluation of this area.</p>
      <p class="p"> 
         <strong class="ph b">NOTE</strong>: Proposals including WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB, and SDVOSB percentages must ensure those socio-economic category submissions are SBA Certified.</p>

Then list each of the intended subcontractors and principal supplies/services to be provided by that subcontractor. Provide the Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code for the prime and each intended subcontractor. Also, provide the anticipated NAICS codes(s) that the prime offeror believes best describes the product or services being acquired by its subcontracts with each intended subcontractor.

         <strong class="ph b">NOTE</strong>: Pursuant to Sections 8(d) of the Small Business Act, a business is considered small for government procurements if it does not exceed the size standard for the NAICS code that the prime contractor believes best describes the product or services being acquired. In other words, the size of the prime’s suppliers is determined by the applicable NAICS code of their joint venture, teaming partner, or subcontract, which may or may not be the same NAICS code as the one for your prime contract with the government.</p>
      <p class="p"> 
         <strong class="ph b">(e)</strong> Describe the extent of commitment to use small businesses (e.g., what types of commitments, if any, are in place for this specific acquisition either – small business prime, written contract, verbal, enforceable, non-enforceable, joint venturing, mentor-protégé, etc.). Provide documentation regarding commitments to small business for this effort. Copies of such agreements should be provided as part of your SBPCD and will not count against the page limitation for this volume.</p>
