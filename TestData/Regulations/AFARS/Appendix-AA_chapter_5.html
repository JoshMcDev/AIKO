            <em class="ph i">Adverse
past performance</em>
        </strong> is defined as past performance
information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any
evaluation. Adverse past performance that must be addressed with
Offerors includes unfavorable comments received from sources such
as those received from respondents from past performance
questionnaires or interviews that have not been finalized within a
formal rating system. A best practice can be to discuss adverse
past performance which caused a rating to be lowered to
Satisfactory Confidence.</p>

costs that a contractor will incur in performing a

        </strong> is the competitive
negotiation process where the government evaluates both cost/price
and non-cost/price factors and awards the contract to the offeror
proposing the combination of factors which offer the best value to
the government. The process is appropriate when it is in the
government’s best interest to consider award to other than
the lowest priced offeror or the highest technically rated
offeror.</p>
      <p class="p">The SSA must then determine if a higher rated technical offer is
“worth” the additional cost to the government.</p>
