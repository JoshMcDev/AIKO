      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. Span of control refers to the extent of
oversight and review responsibilities placed on a single A/OPC, BO,
or CH. An appropriate span of control must efficiently and
effectively allow the A/OPC, BO, or CH to provide reasonable
assurance they can effectively perform their responsibilities
regardless of the number of accounts assigned. The assigned span of
control must factor in the monitoring and oversight
responsibilities to include the use of MasterCard’s Insights
on Demand (IOD) data mining and review process. To ensure GPC
program participants have sufficient time to complete required
reviews, GPC programs will abide by established span-of-control
limits. The following span-of-control internal controls have been
established for the Army GPC Program:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) The number of CH accounts (not individual
cardholders) assigned to a primary BO will not exceed seven.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) An individual may not be assigned more than
three CH accounts.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) An A/OPC will not be responsible for more than
250 GPC accounts (card accounts and MAs combined). This ratio will
be reevaluated biennially.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Primary A/OPC vacancies must be filled in a
timely manner to prevent excessively burdening Alternate A/OPCs
over an extended time.</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) The CPM has authority to approve deviation from
the ratios in 1) through 3) above on a case-by-case basis provided
the organization establishes sufficient local oversight and
compensating controls. Deviation approval is a CPM responsibility
and cannot be delegated.</p>
        <p class="p List2">6) For the ratios in 1) through 3) above,
compensating controls include, at a minimum, briefing the HA on the
deviation(s) and any related ramifications, during all subsequent
Semi-annual Head of Activity Review (SAHAR) briefing(s) in which
the deviation(s) remain in place.</p>
        <p class="p List2">7) For the ratio in item 2) above, as the SAHAR
does not report on the number of CH accounts assigned to an
individual, other compensating controls would need to be in place
for any deviation(s) the CPM approves. Any deviations must be
reported to the HA through the SAHAR process and annotated in the
Notes section of the SAHAR report.</p>
        <p class="p List2">8) When Army policy authorizes use of the GPC for
more complex transactions (e.g., by Ordering Officials), the Army
should institute more stringent span-of-control ratios as
appropriate.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. A/OPCs should use PIEE/JAM or the card-issuing
bank’s EAS to provide appropriate management notification and
reports on various spans of control. All Common Access Card
(CAC)-enabled systems supporting or using GPC data should utilize
functions to define and manage all hierarchies assigned within the
system—not just the GPC organizational hierarchy.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. An individual may not be assigned more than one
CH account for each special designation in their appointment.
Assignment of roles includes effective from/to dates. This includes
personnel assignment to an A/OPC, BO, or CH, as well as the
relationships of the BO to the A/OPC and the CH to the BO.
Management oversight reports should be defined to report personnel,
position, and relationship assignments.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. The card-issuing bank’s EAS report on
span of control based on user ID cannot be used as an irrefutable
source to support span-of-control limits, since an individual may
have more than one bank user ID. A/OPCs must track all roles an
individual has been provisioned/assigned using their unique CAC
public-key infrastructure or other unique identifier that may be
implemented by the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and
Readiness.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. The Army standard for span of control for a
Level 4 A/OPC is 250 BO and CH accounts per Level 4 A/OPC. This
total includes both the BO and CH accounts added together. Span of
control updates are deemed necessary due to changing program
dynamics and increased oversight burdens placed on GPC oversight
personnel over time. As the micro-purchase threshold has increased
multiple times over the years, additional oversight has been
required by GPC personnel as the average dollar value and the types
and complexity of the GPC supplies and services being purchased has
increased.</p>
        <p class="p List1">f. The total number of transactions, as well as
the number of assigned card accounts, must be considered when
determining an acceptable card account to BO ratio. When the number
of accounts or workload complexity/administration assigned to a
Level 4 A/OPC exceeds the Army standard, the SCO/CCO must ensure
adequate resources are made available to allow the A/OPC to
successfully perform their duties. When the span of control exceeds
the Army standard and the CCO elects not to provide additional
resources, the CCO must submit a waiver request in writing to the
CPM for approval. The waiver request must include the rationale and
justification upon which the CCO has based the determination that
the existing span of control is adequate to ensure program
administration and that surveillance can be performed at a
satisfactory level given the existing or new compensatory controls
put in place. The Level 3 A/OPC must retain a copy of this
documentation.</p>
        <p class="p List1">g. The Level 4 A/OPC determines whether the BO to
CH ratio is acceptable upon issuance of a GPC, during the
A/OPC’s annual assessment of their GPC program, or as needed.
There must be a reasonable expectation that the BO can complete a
thorough review of all transactions and certify the invoice within
five business days of its receipt. When the ratio for CH accounts
to BO exceeds the Army standard, the BO should lower the number of
card accounts or request a waiver to policy. The Level 4 A/OPC will
document all cases where the CH to BO ratio exceeds the Army
standard. The waiver to policy request must address the unique
conditions that affect the process and show, with a high degree of
certainty, that the BO can be expected to comply with the review
and certification procedures. The request must include the number
and location of assigned CHs, the total average number of
transactions made by the CHs, the amount of time the BO can devote
to the certification process, the history of delinquencies, and
other appropriate factors. The waiver is approved at the following
levels indicated below and maintained by the approver with copies
furnished to the BO:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) 8–10 card accounts. Routed through the
Level 4 A/OPC to the CCO.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) 11–19 card accounts. Routed through the
A/OPCs (Level 4 and Level 3) to the SCO.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) 20 or more card accounts. Routed through the
A/OPCs (Level 4 and Level 3) to the Level 2.</p>
