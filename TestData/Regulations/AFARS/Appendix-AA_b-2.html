This RFP employs the use of Value Adjusted Total Evaluated Price
(VATEP) techniques which identifies, in advance, the value placed
on above-threshold performance or capabilities in the Air Movement
Mission-Range and Payload, Self-Deployment, and/or Cruise Airspeed
requirements. The specific VATEP procedures and values for this
effort are set forth below:</p>
          <p class="p">
If an offeror’s proposal exceeds the mandatory minimum
performance specifications for the Air Movement Mission-Range and
Payload, Self-Deployment Mission, and/or Cruise Airspeed
requirements set forth in the Air Vehicle technical subfactor, the
following VATEP procedures will be applied:</p>
          <p class="p">
An offeror can earn VATEP evaluation credit for meeting performance
between the threshold and objective for the Air Movement
Mission-Range and Payload and/or Cruise Airspeed requirements. An
offeror can also earn VATEP evaluation credit for meeting the
objective for the Self-Deployment Mission. The VATEP eligible
objectives shall be embodied in the FUA Aircraft and also priced
and delivered in Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) X001AA.</p>
          <p class="p">
The offeror’s total evaluated price for CLIN X001AA will be
adjusted, for evaluation purposes only, in accordance with the
chart below where above-threshold performance has been achieved for
any of the three objectives identified. The VATEP objectives must
be available on the first aircraft in order to be eligible for
VATEP evaluation credit. Risk will not be assessed in VATEP since
risk was already assessed in the Air Vehicle subfactor.</p>

            <em class="ph i">Example:</em> The Army is buying a large equipment trailer
(LET) using VATEP, and one of the requirements is maximum payload.
The threshold is 80,000 lbs., and the objective is 85,000. As
stated in the RFP, During Step 2 of the VATEP process the SST will
adjust each offeror’s total proposed price (TPP) to derive
the total evaluated price (TEP) by $1,000 for each 50 lbs. of
increased payload over the threshold, for a maximum adjustment to
the TEP of $100,000. This adjustment is for evaluation purposes
only, and will not change the proposed pricing, which will become
the awarded price. If an offeror proposes the threshold for
payload, then they will receive no adjustment.</p>
          <p class="p">In this example, four proposals are received:</p>
          <p class="p"> Offeror A: TPP=$1,050,000; at least an
“acceptable” rating for all minimum requirements,
proposes a maximum payload of 83,500 lbs., an increase of 3,500
lbs. over the threshold.</p>
          <p class="p"> Offeror B: TPP=$1,000,000; at least an
“acceptable” rating for all minimum requirements,
proposes the threshold maximum payload of 80,000 lbs.</p>
          <p class="p"> Offeror C: TPP=$1,150,000; at least an
“acceptable” rating for all minimum requirements,
proposes a maximum payload at the objective level of 85,000 lbs.,
an increase of 5,000 lbs. over the threshold</p>
          <p class="p"> Offeror D: TPP=$950,000; “unacceptable” for
two minimum requirements, proposes a maximum payload at the
objective level of 85,000 lbs., an increase of 5,000 lbs. over the
threshold. <em class="ph i">Offeror D is eliminated in Step 1.</em>
          </p>
          <p class="p">At the conclusion of Step 1, offeror B has the lowest TPP, with
offeror A as the second-lowest cost/price and Offeror C as the
highest price. However, offerors A and C have their TPPs adjusted
since they have proposed maximum payloads above the threshold,
while offeror B has no adjustment since they have proposed only the
threshold maximum payload. The TEP adjustments are as follows:</p>
          <p class="p"> Offeror A has proposed an increase of 3,500 lbs., which
leads to a decrease of their TPP by $70,000, for a TEP of
$980,000.</p>
          <p class="p"> Offeror B has proposed the threshold and receives no
adjustment to their TPP. Therefore, their TEP is $1,000,000.</p>
          <p class="p"> Offeror C has a proposed increase of 5,000 lbs., which
leads to a decrease of their TPP by the maximum amount of $100,000,
for a TEP of $1,050,000.</p>
