        <p class="p List1">a. BOs must review LOAs selected by the CH as part
of the review, reconciliation, and certification process. Payments
are generally rejected because of missing or incorrect LOAs. The
Army’s financial management system will also reject missing
or incorrect LOAs, requiring the finance office to make corrections
or complete a manual payment in the system. When this happens, the
A/OPC will notify the BO when a payment has been rejected in the
system. The BO must immediately contact their RM for assistance in
obligating funds in the system and processing the manual payment.
For GFEBS-funded accounts, follow the GFEBS manual payment
process.</p>
