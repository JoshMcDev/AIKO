        <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-6___1-6._Applicability">a. These procedures
apply to all GPC purchases with cards and convenience checks issued
by the Army. Non-Army tenant organizations issued Army GPCs or
convenience checks by an Army contracting office are also subject
to these procedures. All BOs, CHs, A/OPCs, Resource Managers (RMs),
Logisticians, and other stakeholders participating in the Army GPC
program are subject to these procedures, including any non-Army
tenant organizations where the Army has contracting authority and
oversight responsibilities (such as ANG units).</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. The ODASA(P) has overall responsibility for the
Army GPC program. Each Army command, organization, or activity
utilizing Army GPCs has the responsibility for the following
actions:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Provide adequate resources and effective
internal controls to ensure the appropriate management, operation,
training, and oversight is in place to operate a local GPC program
effectively and efficiently in compliance with Army policies and
procedures.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Establish and maintain a command climate to
prevent Army personnel or others from exercising undue influence
over the actions of an A/OPC, BO or CH.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Take appropriate informal and formal
disciplinary actions in the event of noncompliance, fraud, misuse
and/or abuse. Disciplinary actions should be based on the severity
and frequency of the infraction and can range from informal actions
such as written or verbal counseling, to demotion, removal, loss of
security clearance, or potential criminal prosecution.</p>
