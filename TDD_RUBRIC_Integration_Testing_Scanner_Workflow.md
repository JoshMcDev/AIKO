**Target**: Zero race conditions or deadlocks under concurrent access
**Validation**: DocumentImageProcessor actor isolation verified
**Evidence**: 
- Stress testing with multiple simultaneous scan requests

### E4: Error Recovery & User Experience ✅
**Target**: Graceful degradation under all failure scenarios
**Validation**: Error states propagate correctly through TCA
**Evidence**:
