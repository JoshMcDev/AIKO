### Verification

All documents now reflect:
- ✅ 10 performance-optimized n8n workflows (not 15)
- ✅ 4.2x performance improvement (not 3.8x)
- ✅ 12-week timeline (not 15 weeks)
- ✅ Performance optimization as top priority
- ✅ All tasks aligned with Task Master AI

4. **Performance Priority Reversion (January 14, 2025)**
   - Reverted priority back to Performance Optimization (from brief stability consideration)
   - Task Master AI Priority Updates:
     - Task #21 (AI Document Generator Performance) → High Priority
     - Task #22 (Object Action Handler Optimization) → High Priority
     - Task #26 (Error Handling Enhancement) → Medium Priority (was High)
     - Task #27 (Test Coverage) → Medium Priority (was Critical)
   
   - Todo Folder Updates:
     - **Todo_00_CurrentWorking_TodoList.md**: Added Performance Optimization section with 10 workflows
     - **03_Working_Tasks.md**: Updated task priorities and added Integration Tasks section
     - **02_Current_Phase_Reference.md**: Already contained integration tasks

5. **VanillaIce Token Limit Update**
   - Tripled all token limits in vanillaice-engine.js:
     - Example: grok-4: 1000 → 3000 tokens
     - Example: gemini-2.5-pro: 2000 → 6000 tokens
     - All 14 models updated with 3x token limits

### Verification

All documents now reflect:
- ✅ Performance optimization as top priority (not stability)
- ✅ 10 performance-optimized n8n workflows (not 15)
- ✅ 4.2x performance improvement (not 3.8x)
- ✅ 12-week timeline (not 15 weeks)
- ✅ Task priorities aligned with performance focus
- ✅ VanillaIce token limits tripled
- ✅ All tasks aligned with Task Master AI

### Next Steps

1. Review and approve the 10 workflows
2. Begin Phase 1 infrastructure preparation with performance focus
3. Track progress through Task Master AI
4. Execute according to 12-week timeline
5. Monitor performance metrics against 4.2x target
