# AIKO Task Pipeline

> A 10-stage pipeline for tracking task progression from planning to deployment with multi-agent support

## Overview

The AIKO project implements a comprehensive task management system that integrates:
- 6-phase deployment strategy over 14 weeks
- 10-stage quality pipeline for each task (stages 1-10)
- Multi-agent parallel processing capability
- Task Master AI integration for tracking
- 95% production-ready standard

## Pipeline Stages

1. **Phased Plan** → 6-phase deployment strategy
2. **Current Phase** → Active phase status and quick commands
3. **Working Tasks** → Planning, design, and task breakdown
4. **Working SubTasks** → Detailed subtask and sub-subtask breakdown
5. **Parallel Tasks** → Multi-agent parallel development
6. **Completed Tasks** → Code complete, awaiting testing
7. **Tested Tasks** → All tests passing (0 errors, 0 warnings)
8. **Verified Tasks** → Quality score ≥ 95/100, simulation ready
9. **Certified Tasks** → Passed simulation, production-ready
10. **Deployed Tasks** → Beta versions with version tracking

## Task Master AI Integration

All tasks are tracked in Task Master AI:
- Phase tracking: Tasks #8-13 (Phases 1-6)
- Implementation tasks: #1-7, #14-15
- Use `--projectRoot /Users/J/aiko` for all commands

## Task Format

```markdown
### Task ID: Task Name
- [ ] Subtask 1
- [ ] Subtask 2
**Status**: Not Started/In Progress/Complete
**Complexity**: Low/Medium/High (X/10)
**Dependencies**: Task IDs
**See**: Reference to detailed subtasks
```

## Workflow

1. **Phase Planning**: Tasks aligned to current phase (Phase 1: Weeks 1-2)
2. **Task Breakdown**: Complex tasks get subtasks and sub-subtasks
3. **Parallel Distribution**: Ready tasks move to `05_Parallel_Tasks.md`
4. **Quality Gates**: Each task must pass ALL 10 stages
5. **Task Master Sync**: Update status at each stage transition

## Multi-Agent Processing

Tasks in `05_Parallel_Tasks.md` can be distributed:
- Subtasks assigned to different agents
- Independent parallel execution
- Sync points at task completion
- Integration testing required

## Success Criteria by Stage

- **Phased Plan → Current Phase**: Phase selected and activated
- **Current Phase → Working**: Tasks identified and prioritized
- **Working → SubTasks**: Task breakdown complete, sub-subtasks defined
- **SubTasks → Parallel**: Ready for multi-agent distribution
- **Parallel → Completed**: All subtasks complete, integrated
- **Completed → Tested**: 0 errors, 0 warnings
- **Tested → Verified**: Score ≥ 95/100, ready for simulation
- **Verified → Certified**: Passed simulation, security verified, docs complete, production ready
- **Certified → Deployed**: Beta version released with tracking

## Quality Gates

| Stage | Minimum Requirement | Target |
|-------|-------------------|---------|
| Tested | 0 errors, 0 warnings | 100% pass |
| Verified | 85/100 score | 95/100 score |
| Certified | Simulation pass, production ready | 98/100 score |
| Deployed | Working beta | Zero defects |

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Check current phase
/task-master-ai.get_task --projectRoot /Users/J/aiko --id 8 --withSubtasks

# Start a task
/task-master-ai.set_task_status --projectRoot /Users/J/aiko --id 1 --status in-progress

# View all tasks
/task-master-ai.get_tasks --projectRoot /Users/J/aiko --withSubtasks
```

## Tracking Metrics

- **Velocity**: Tasks moving through pipeline per week
- **Quality**: Average verification scores
- **Cycle Time**: Days from Working to Deployed
- **Defect Rate**: Issues found in each stage
- **Rework Rate**: Tasks moving backward

## Best Practices

1. **Never Skip Stages**: Each stage has important quality checks
2. **Document Everything**: Track decisions and changes
3. **Maintain Standards**: Don't lower scores to push through
4. **Regular Reviews**: Daily sync for parallel tasks
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Update based on learnings
