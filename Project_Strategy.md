## Executive Summary

The AIKO iOS project has experienced severe scope creep, expanding from 6 to 16 phases with 255 subtasks. This revision acknowledges the substantial progress already made (Phases 1-3 complete) and pivots to leverage user-chosen LLM providers for all intelligence and automation rather than building complex ML/AI systems locally. 

### Core Philosophy: Simple, Native Productivity with LLM-Powered Intelligence

**Let LLMs handle intelligence. Let iOS handle the interface. Let users achieve more with less effort.**

By leveraging user-chosen LLM providers for all complex decision-making, prompt optimization, compliance checking, and workflow orchestration, we deliver a powerful yet simple iOS app that adapts to any LLM provider, provides transparent justifications for every decision, and guides users with intelligent suggestions—all in just 7.5 more weeks.
