# Product Requirements Document: Comprehensive File & Media Management Suite
## Enhanced Version Based on AIKO Codebase Analysis

**Version**: 2.0 Enhanced  
**Date**: 2025-07-23  
**Project**: AIKO Smart Form Auto-Population  
**Phase**: 4 Final Task → Phase 5 Transition  
**Codebase Analysis**: ✅ Complete

## 1. Executive Summary

The Comprehensive File & Media Management Suite extends AIKO's proven DocumentScannerFeature architecture into a complete media ecosystem. Building on the existing MediaManagementClients interfaces and TCA architecture patterns, this feature will provide full implementation of file upload, photo library access, camera capture, and screenshot functionality with seamless integration into the established form auto-population workflow.

**Strategic Foundation**: Leverages AIKO's mature TCA architecture, actor-based concurrency (ProgressTrackingEngine, SessionEngine, BatchProcessor), session management patterns (ScanSession model), and real-time progress infrastructure to deliver comprehensive media capabilities while maintaining <200ms performance standards.

## 2. Current State Analysis - Codebase Foundation

### 2.1 Existing Architecture Assets

**Mature TCA Foundation**:
- ✅ **DocumentScannerFeature**: Exemplar architecture with `@ObservableState`, hierarchical actions, effect handling
- ✅ **Actor-Based Concurrency**: ProgressTrackingEngine, SessionEngine, BatchProcessor with proven <200ms latency
- ✅ **Session Management**: ScanSession, SessionPage, BatchOperationState with auto-save and error recovery
- ✅ **Progress Infrastructure**: ProgressClient, ProgressBridge with AsyncStream real-time updates
- ✅ **GlobalScanFeature**: Universal access pattern from all 19 app screens

**Media Client Interfaces** (MediaManagementClients.swift):
```swift
// EXISTING INTERFACES - NEED IMPLEMENTATION
- FilePickerClient: File selection with type validation
- PhotoLibraryClient: Photo library access and selection  
- ScreenshotClient: Screen capture and recording capabilities
- MediaValidationClient: File validation, size limits, malware scanning
- MediaMetadataClient: EXIF extraction and thumbnail generation
```

**Integration Points Available**:

### 2.2 Current Implementation Gaps

**Media Client Implementations**:
- MediaManagementClients have interface definitions but placeholder implementations
- No MediaManagementFeature TCA implementation exists
- No UI components for media selection and management
- Missing integration between media types and existing document workflow

## 3. Technical Architecture - Building on Proven Patterns

### 3.1 MediaManagementFeature TCA Architecture

**Following DocumentScannerFeature Pattern**:

```swift
@ObservableState
public struct MediaManagementState {
    // Session Management (based on ScanSession pattern)
    public var currentSession: MediaSession = .init()
    public var mediaItems: IdentifiedArrayOf<MediaItem> = []
    
    // Processing State (following DocumentScannerFeature)
    public var processingMode: ProcessingMode = .idle
    public var progress: ProgressState = .init()
    
    // Integration State
    public var formIntegration: FormIntegrationState = .init()
    public var selectedItems: Set<MediaItem.ID> = []
}

public enum MediaManagementAction {
    // User Actions
    case uploadFileButtonTapped
    case photoLibraryButtonTapped  
    case cameraButtonTapped
    case screenshotButtonTapped
    case mediaItemSelected(MediaItem.ID)
    
    // Processing Actions (following DocumentScannerFeature pattern)
    case filePickerResult(TaskResult<[URL]>)
    case photoLibraryResult(TaskResult<[PHAsset]>)
    case mediaProcessingUpdate(MediaProcessingUpdate)
    case progressUpdate(ProgressUpdate)
    
    // Integration Actions
    case formAutoPopulationRequested([MediaItem.ID])
    case shareRequested([MediaItem.ID])
}
```

    public let id: UUID
    public var mediaItems: IdentifiedArrayOf<MediaItem>
    public var processingState: ProcessingState
    public var metadata: SessionMetadata
    public var autoSave: Bool = true
    
    // Following ScanSession pattern
    public var totalItems: Int { mediaItems.count }
    public var processedItems: Int { mediaItems.filter(\.isProcessed).count }
    public var progressPercentage: Double { 
        guard totalItems > 0 else { return 0 }
        return Double(processedItems) / Double(totalItems)
    }
}

public struct MediaItem: Equatable, Codable, Identifiable, Sendable {
    public let id: UUID
    public var type: MediaType
    public var originalURL: URL
    public var processedURL: URL?
    public var metadata: MediaMetadata
    public var processingStatus: ProcessingStatus
    public var formIntegrationStatus: FormIntegrationStatus
}
```

### 3.4 Progress Integration

**Extending ProgressTrackingEngine**:

```swift
@globalActor
public actor MediaProcessingEngine {
    // Following BatchProcessor pattern
    private let maxConcurrentOperations = 3
    private var activeOperations: Set<UUID> = []
    private let progressClient: ProgressClient
    
    public func processMediaItems(_ items: [MediaItem]) async throws -> [ProcessedMediaItem] {
        // Reuse proven BatchProcessor concurrency patterns
        // Integrate with existing ProgressClient for real-time updates
        // Apply existing error recovery and cleanup patterns
    }
}
```
