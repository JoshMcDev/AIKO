## 🔍 Issue Analysis & Categorization

### 🚨 Critical/Blocking Issues (Immediate Priority)

#### 1. Typealias Redeclaration Conflicts
**File**: `Sources/Infrastructure/Repositories/AcquisitionRepository.swift`
```swift
// Error: invalid redeclaration of 'CoreDataAcquisition'
typealias CoreDataAcquisition = Acquisition
```
**Impact**: Prevents compilation of infrastructure layer  
**Solution**: Implement unique typealias naming or explicit module qualification  
**Effort**: 2-4 hours  

#### 2. Sendable Conformance for Domain Aggregates
**File**: `Sources/Domain/Models/AcquisitionAggregate.swift`
```swift
// Error: type 'AcquisitionAggregate' does not conform to the 'Sendable' protocol
class AcquisitionAggregate { ... }
```
**Impact**: Blocks async operations in repositories  
**Solution**: Add Sendable conformance to domain aggregates  
**Effort**: 4-6 hours  

### ⚠️ Important Issues (Medium Priority)

#### 3. Missing Sendable Conformance for Data Types
**Affected Types**: `FormRecommendation`, `FormGuidance`, various service DTOs
**Impact**: Non-blocking but prevents full strict concurrency enablement
**Solution**: Systematic addition of Sendable conformance
**Effort**: 6-8 hours

#### 4. Actor Boundary Clarification
**Areas**: Core Data access patterns, service layer interactions
**Impact**: Performance and safety optimization opportunities
**Solution**: Define clear actor boundaries per existing patterns
**Effort**: 4-6 hours

### 🧹 Cleanup Issues (Low Priority)

#### 5. Deprecated CoreDataActor Methods
**File**: `Sources/Infrastructure/CoreDataActor.swift`
**Impact**: Code maintenance and clarity
**Solution**: Remove deprecated methods marked for deletion
**Effort**: 2-3 hours

#### 6. @unchecked Sendable Removal
**Scope**: Final pass to eliminate unsafe annotations
**Impact**: Code safety and maintainability
**Solution**: Replace with proper Sendable implementations
**Effort**: 3-4 hours

#if os(iOS)
    // iOS implementation
#else
    // macOS implementation  
#endif

// After: Clean separation
// iOS: Sources/AIKOiOS/iOSSpecificService.swift
// macOS: Sources/AIKOmacOS/macOSSpecificService.swift
```
**Impact**: Dramatically improved maintainability and testability

#### Type Conflict Resolution ✅

```swift
// AikoCompat provides Sendable-safe wrappers
actor AnthropicWrapper {
    private let client: SwiftAnthropic // Non-Sendable
    
    func createMessage(...) async throws -> MessageResponse {
        // Safe async wrapper around non-Sendable API
    }

## 🔄 Current Development Patterns

### ✅ Proven Successful Patterns

#### 1. Module-by-Module Migration
**Pattern**: Enable strict concurrency one target at a time
**Success Rate**: 100% (4/4 targets completed successfully)
**Benefit**: Isolated changes, reduced risk, clear progress tracking

#### 2. Compatibility Layer for Third-Party Dependencies
**Pattern**: Wrap non-Sendable dependencies in actor-based proxies
**Implementation**: AikoCompat module with strict concurrency enabled
**Benefit**: Maintains safety while using necessary third-party libraries

#### 3. Explicit Type Qualification
**Pattern**: Use module prefixes to resolve type conflicts
```swift
// Clear distinction between types
let businessModel: AppCore.Acquisition = ...
let coreDataEntity: CoreDataAcquisition = ...
```
**Benefit**: Eliminates ambiguity and improves code clarity

#### 4. Actor-Based Data Access
**Pattern**: Isolate Core Data operations behind dedicated actors
```swift
actor CoreDataActor {
    func performViewContextTask<T>(...) async throws -> T {
        // Safe Core Data access patterns
    }
}
```
**Benefit**: Thread-safe data access with clear boundaries

### 🔧 Patterns for Final Implementation

#### 1. Systematic Sendable Conformance
**Strategy**: Add Sendable conformance to data types systematically
**Approach**: Start with domain models, then DTOs, then view models
**Validation**: Compile and test after each group

#### 2. Domain Aggregate Modernization
**Strategy**: Update domain aggregates to support Swift concurrency
**Approach**: Maintain existing APIs while adding Sendable support
**Validation**: Ensure business logic remains unchanged
