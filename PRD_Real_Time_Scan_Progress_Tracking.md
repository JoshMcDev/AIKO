# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# Real-Time Scan Progress Tracking

**Date:** 2025-07-21  
**Project:** AIKO Smart Form Auto-Population  
**Priority:** Medium  
**TDD Phase:** /prd

## Executive Summary

Implement real-time progress tracking for document scanning operations to provide users with immediate feedback during scanning, processing, and OCR operations. This feature enhances user experience by reducing perceived wait times and providing transparency into the scanning workflow.

## Problem Statement

Currently, users experience "black box" behavior during document scanning where they have no visibility into:
- Scanning progress and current operation status
- Processing time estimates
- Error states or recovery attempts
- Operation completion indicators

This leads to user uncertainty, perceived slowness, and poor user experience during document scanning workflows.

## Business Objectives

### Primary Goals
- **Improve User Experience**: Reduce perceived wait times through progress visibility
- **Increase User Confidence**: Provide transparency into scanning operations
- **Enable Error Recovery**: Allow users to understand and respond to issues
- **Enhance Accessibility**: Support screen readers and assistive technologies

### Success Metrics
- 25% reduction in user abandonment during scanning
- 90%+ user satisfaction with progress feedback clarity
- <200ms latency for progress updates
- 100% accessibility compliance for progress indicators

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **Government Contractors**: Need reliable progress feedback for form scanning
- **Field Workers**: Require clear status for mobile scanning operations
- **Accessibility Users**: Need screen reader compatible progress updates

### User Stories

**As a government contractor**, I want to see real-time progress when scanning documents so that I know the system is working and can estimate completion time.

**As a field worker**, I want to understand what scanning step is currently running so that I can troubleshoot if issues occur.

**As a user with visual impairments**, I want progress updates announced by screen readers so that I can track scanning progress without visual cues.
