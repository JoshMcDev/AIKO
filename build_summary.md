# AIKO Build Summary

## Actions Taken

1. **Verified Swift 6 Concurrency Fixes**
   - Added `@preconcurrency` to `DependencyKey` conformance in:
     - `LLMManager.swift` (line 299)
     - `LLMConversationManager.swift` (line 395)

2. **Cleaned Build Caches**
   - Created `deep_cache_clean.sh` to aggressively clear all Xcode caches
   - Removed DerivedData, Module caches, SPM caches, and LLVM profile data

3. **Opened Project in Xcode**
   - Opened Package.swift in Xcode for building
   - Xcode is currently building the project with multiple active processes

## Build Status
- Previous error.txt showed Swift 6 warnings but build succeeded
- Fixes have been applied to source code
- Cache has been cleared to ensure fresh compilation
- error.txt has been removed from Desktop (likely because build is now clean)
- Xcode is actively building the project

## Scripts Created
1. `force_clean_rebuild.sh` - Basic clean and rebuild script
2. `deep_cache_clean.sh` - Aggressive cache cleaning script
3. `verify_fixes.sh` - Verification script to confirm fixes are in place

## Next Steps
Wait for Xcode build to complete and check for any warnings or errors in the Xcode interface.
