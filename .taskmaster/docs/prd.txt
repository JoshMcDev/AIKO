# AIKO MVP: Adaptive LLM-Driven Acquisition Assistant

## Project Overview
AIKO is an Adaptive LLM-Driven Acquisition Assistant that helps users define acquisition requirements through minimal prompting. The system learns from previous acquisitions, automatically reviews regulations, and builds complete document chains with one-click automation.

## Current Implementation Status
The project has completed initial setup including:
- User authentication and profile management  
- SAM.gov integration
- Basic acquisitions tracking
- User guide
- Agency field added to profile for regulation mapping
- Regulation repository system created

## Key MVP Requirements

### 1. Document Parser Implementation
Implement a comprehensive document parser that can handle:
- PDF files (including scanned documents)
- Word documents (.doc, .docx)
- Image files with OCR capability
- Extract key acquisition data from uploaded documents
- Store parsed data in structured format for processing

### 2. Adaptive Prompting Engine
Build an intelligent prompting system that:
- Minimizes questions asked to users
- Uses context from uploaded documents to reduce prompting
- Learns from user patterns to predict responses
- Provides smart defaults based on historical data
- Implements conversational flow for requirement gathering

### 3. Historical Data Matching System
Create an auto-population system that:
- Matches current acquisitions with similar past ones
- Auto-fills common fields based on patterns
- Suggests values based on user history
- Learns from corrections to improve predictions
- Maintains user-specific learning profiles

### 4. FAR/DFAR Rules Engine
Develop a comprehensive regulation engine that:
- Maps regulations to specific acquisition types
- Identifies required documentation automatically
- Validates compliance with applicable rules
- Provides regulation-specific guidance
- Updates when regulations change

### 5. Regulation Update Monitoring
Build a service to:
- Monitor acquisition.gov repositories for updates
- Download and process regulation changes
- Alert users to relevant updates
- Maintain version history of regulations
- Ensure compliance with latest requirements

### 6. One-Click Document Chain Automation
Implement automated document generation:
- Build complete acquisition document chains
- Allow user-defined approval points
- Generate all required forms automatically
- Ensure document consistency and compliance
- Support multiple output formats

### 7. Email Delivery Integration
Add email capabilities for:
- Sending generated documents to stakeholders
- Notification of approval requirements
- Status updates on acquisition progress
- Delivery of completed document packages
- Integration with existing email systems

## Technical Architecture
The system uses SwiftUI for iOS with:
- Claude API integration for document generation
- Core Data for persistence
- Adaptive learning algorithms
- Real-time regulation checking
- Secure document handling

## Success Criteria
- 95% reduction in manual data entry
- Complete FAR/DFAR compliance
- One-click document generation working
- Learning system improving with usage
- All document types parsing correctly
