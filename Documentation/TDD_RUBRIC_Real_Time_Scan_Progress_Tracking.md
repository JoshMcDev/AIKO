**Date:** 2025-07-21  
**Project:** AIKO Smart Form Auto-Population  
**Feature:** Real-Time Scan Progress Tracking  
**TDD Phase:** /tdd

## Measures of Effectiveness (MoE)

### MoE-1: Progress Update Latency
**Target:** <200ms from service event to UI update  
**Critical Success Factor:** User perceives real-time feedback

**Test Cases:**
- Progress update latency measurement across all phases
- High-frequency update performance under load
- Network latency impact on progress delivery
- Concurrent session progress update isolation

**Validation Criteria:**
- 95% of progress updates delivered within 200ms
- 99% of progress updates delivered within 500ms
- No progress update delivery failures under normal load
- Latency remains consistent across scanning phases

### MoE-2: Progress Information Accuracy
**Target:** Progress values reflect actual completion state  
**Critical Success Factor:** Users can trust progress indicators

**Test Cases:**
- Progress percentage accuracy validation
- Phase transition timing correctness
- Time remaining estimation accuracy (±30% target)
- Progress reset behavior on errors/cancellation

**Validation Criteria:**
- Progress values monotonically increase (no backwards movement)
- Phase transitions occur at appropriate completion points
- Time estimates within 30% of actual completion time
- Progress state accurately reflects current operation

### MoE-3: Cross-Platform Consistency
**Target:** Identical behavior across iOS and macOS  
**Critical Success Factor:** Unified user experience

**Test Cases:**
- iOS UIProgressView integration validation
- macOS NSProgressIndicator integration validation
- SwiftUI component rendering consistency
- Platform-specific progress indicator styling

**Validation Criteria:**
- Progress values synchronized across platforms
- Visual consistency in progress representation
- Platform-specific adaptations maintain core functionality
- No platform-specific progress tracking failures

### MoE-4: Accessibility Compliance
**Target:** 100% VoiceOver and screen reader compatibility  
**Critical Success Factor:** Inclusive user experience

**Test Cases:**
- VoiceOver progress milestone announcements
- Screen reader compatibility with progress descriptions
- High contrast mode progress visibility
- Reduced motion alternative implementations

**Validation Criteria:**
- VoiceOver announces progress at 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%
- Progress descriptions read accurately by screen readers
- High contrast mode maintains progress visibility
- Reduced motion users receive equivalent progress feedback

## Measures of Performance (MoP)

### MoP-1: System Resource Utilization
**Performance Targets:**
- CPU Overhead: <5% during progress tracking
- Memory Footprint: <10MB additional for progress system  
- Battery Impact: <2% additional drain during scanning
- Network Overhead: Zero additional network requests

**Benchmarking Tests:**
```swift
func testCPUOverheadDuringProgressTracking() async throws {
    let baseline = measureCPUUsage()
    
    // Start intensive progress tracking scenario
    let progressSession = await startHighFrequencyProgressSession()
    
    let overhead = measureCPUUsage() - baseline
    XCTAssertLessThan(overhead, 0.05, "CPU overhead must be <5%")
}

func testMemoryFootprintProgression() async throws {
    let baselineMemory = getCurrentMemoryUsage()
    
    // Create 10 concurrent progress sessions
    let sessions = await createConcurrentProgressSessions(count: 10)
    
    let memoryIncrease = getCurrentMemoryUsage() - baselineMemory
    XCTAssertLessThan(memoryIncrease, 10_000_000, "Memory footprint must be <10MB")
}
```

### MoP-2: Concurrent Session Handling
**Performance Targets:**
- Support: Up to 5 concurrent progress sessions
- Isolation: No cross-session interference
- Scalability: Linear performance degradation
- Recovery: Graceful handling of session failures

**Concurrency Tests:**
```swift
func testConcurrentProgressSessionIsolation() async throws {
    let sessionCount = 5
    let expectations = (1...sessionCount).map { 
        XCTestExpectation(description: "Session \($0) completes independently")
    }
    
    await withTaskGroup(of: Void.self) { group in
        for index in 1...sessionCount {
            group.addTask {
                let result = await progressClient.trackProgress(sessionId: UUID())
                // Verify session isolation and independence
                expectations[index - 1].fulfill()
            }
        }
    }
    
    await fulfillment(of: expectations, timeout: 30.0)
}
```

### MoP-3: Error Recovery Performance
**Performance Targets:**
- Recovery Time: <1 second from error to functional state
- Error Detection: <100ms to detect progress tracking failure
- Fallback Latency: <50ms to engage fallback mode
- User Notification: <200ms to inform user of degraded functionality

**Error Recovery Tests:**
```swift
func testProgressTrackingErrorRecovery() async throws {
    let errorInjectionTime = CFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent()
    
    // Inject progress tracking failure
    await injectProgressTrackingError(.networkFailure)
    
    let recoveryTime = await measureTimeToRecovery()
    XCTAssertLessThan(recoveryTime, 1.0, "Error recovery must complete within 1 second")
}
```

### MoP-4: Integration Performance
**Performance Targets:**
- VisionKit Integration: Zero additional scanning latency
- DocumentProcessor Integration: <10ms overhead per processing update
- OCR Integration: <20ms overhead per recognition update
- TCA Integration: <5ms action dispatch latency

**Integration Performance Tests:**
```swift
func testVisionKitIntegrationOverhead() async throws {
    // Measure baseline scanning performance
    let baselineTime = await measureScanningTime(withProgress: false)
    
    // Measure scanning performance with progress tracking
    let progressTime = await measureScanningTime(withProgress: true)
    
    let overhead = progressTime - baselineTime
    XCTAssertLessThan(overhead, 0.1, "VisionKit progress integration overhead <100ms")
}
```
