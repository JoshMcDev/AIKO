# Comprehensive File & Media Management Suite - Product Requirements Document

## üìã Project Context

**Project**: AIKO (Adaptive Intelligence for Kontract Optimization)  
**Phase**: 4 - Enhanced Document & Media Management (Final Task)  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Enhanced PRD (VanillaIce Consensus Validated)  
**Date**: January 24, 2025  
**Engineering Estimate**: 38-45 weeks (with 25% risk buffer)

## üéØ Executive Summary

The Comprehensive File & Media Management Suite (CFMMS) represents the final enhancement to AIKO's Phase 4 document management capabilities. This suite extends the existing document scanner functionality with complete file and media operations, providing a unified iOS-native interface for all content management needs in government contracting workflows.

### Core Value Proposition
Transform AIKO into a complete media management platform that seamlessly integrates file operations with AI-powered form auto-population, maintaining the project's philosophy of "Let LLMs handle intelligence. Let iOS handle the interface."

### VanillaIce Consensus Summary
**Status**: ‚úÖ Approved with architectural enhancements  
**Models Consensus**: 5/5 models validated approach  
**Key Requirements**: TCA sub-store architecture, Swift 6 Sendable compliance, FedRAMP security controls

## üîç Problem Statement

### Current State
- AIKO has excellent document scanning and OCR capabilities (DocumentImageProcessor + VisionKit)
- Users can generate and auto-populate forms from scanned content (ConfidenceBasedAutoFillEngine)
- Limited to document scanning only - missing comprehensive file and media management

### Gap Analysis
1. **File Import Limitations**: No ability to import existing files from device storage
2. **Photo Management**: Limited photo handling beyond scanning
3. **Screenshot Integration**: No native screenshot capture and processing
4. **Media Validation**: Missing file type validation and metadata extraction
5. **Sharing Constraints**: Limited export and sharing capabilities across media types

### User Pain Points
- "I have photos on my device I want to process for forms, but can only use the scanner"
- "Need to capture screenshots of vendor portals for acquisition records"
- "Want to import existing contract files and extract information for new forms"
- "Sharing processed documents requires multiple steps across different apps"

## üéØ Objectives & Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Complete Media Coverage**: Support all major file and media types relevant to government contracting
2. **TCA Architecture Integration**: Proper sub-store scoping with domain-specific reducers
3. **Swift 6 Compliance**: Full Sendable conformance and structured concurrency
4. **Government Security**: FedRAMP Moderate controls with zero-trust attestation

### Success Metrics
- **Media Type Support**: 15+ file formats (PDF, DOCX, JPG, PNG, HEIC, etc.)
- **Processing Performance**: <3 seconds for image optimization, <5 seconds for document processing
- **Memory Budget**: <50MB during bulk thumbnail generation, <120ms cold-start
- **Security Compliance**: 100% FedRAMP Moderate control implementation

## üèóÔ∏è Enhanced Technical Architecture (TCA + Swift 6)

### Core TCA Sub-Store Architecture

```swift
// Domain-Specific Sub-Stores (VanillaIce Recommendation)
struct MediaManagementState: Equatable, Sendable {
    var fileStore: FileStoreState = .init()
    var photoStore: PhotoStoreState = .init()
    var cameraStore: CameraStoreState = .init()
    var screenshotStore: ScreenshotStoreState = .init()
    var sharingStore: SharingStoreState = .init()
}

@Reducer
struct MediaManagementFeature {
    var body: some ReducerOf<Self> {
        Scope(state: \.fileStore, action: \.fileStore) {
            FileStoreFeature()
        }
        Scope(state: \.photoStore, action: \.photoStore) {
            PhotoStoreFeature()
        }
        Scope(state: \.cameraStore, action: \.cameraStore) {
            CameraStoreFeature()
        }
        Scope(state: \.screenshotStore, action: \.screenshotStore) {
            ScreenshotStoreFeature()
        }
        Scope(state: \.sharingStore, action: \.sharingStore) {
            SharingStoreFeature()
        }
        
        Reduce { state, action in
            // Cross-store coordination logic
        }
    }
}
```

### Swift 6 Sendable Data Models

```swift
// Full Sendable Compliance (VanillaIce Requirement)
struct MediaAsset: Identifiable, Codable, Sendable, Equatable {
    let id: UUID
    let type: MediaType
    let sourceURL: URL
    let metadata: MediaMetadata
    let processingState: ProcessingState
    let ocrResult: OCRResult?
    let createdAt: Date
}

enum MediaType: String, CaseIterable, Sendable, Codable {
    case document, image, photo, screenshot
}

struct MediaMetadata: Sendable, Codable, Equatable {
    let fileSize: Int64
    let dimensions: CGSize?
    let creationDate: Date
    let modificationDate: Date
    let exifData: EXIFData?
    let documentProperties: DocumentProperties?
}

enum ProcessingState: String, Sendable, Codable, Equatable {
    case pending, processing, completed, failed
    case scanning(ScanningSubState)
    
    enum ScanningSubState: String, Sendable, Codable, Equatable {
        case capturing, generatingThumbnail, extractingText, completed
    }
}
```

### Actor-Based Service Layer

```swift
// Non-isolated actor services for heavy I/O (VanillaIce Requirement)
actor MediaCoordinatorService: Sendable {
    private let thumbnailGenerator: ThumbnailGeneratorService
    private let compressionService: CompressionService
    private let syncCoordinator: SyncCoordinatorService
    
    func processMediaAsset(_ asset: MediaAsset) async throws -> ProcessedMediaAsset {
        // Stream processing with back-pressure using AsyncChannel
        let progressStream = AsyncChannel<ProcessingProgress>()
        // Implementation with memory budget enforcement
    }
}

actor SyncCoordinatorService: Sendable {
    // Last-writer-wins + vector clock for conflict resolution
    func synchronizeAssets(_ assets: [MediaAsset]) async throws -> [MediaAsset] {
        // Vector clock implementation for TCA side-effect purity
    }
}
```
