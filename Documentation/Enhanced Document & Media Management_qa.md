## üö® **CRITICAL BLOCKING ISSUES DISCOVERED**

### 1. **Git Merge Conflict Markers Throughout Codebase**
**Severity**: üö® **CRITICAL**  
**Impact**: Complete build failure, deployment blocking

**Affected Files** (Partial List):
- `/Sources/Core/Components/VisualEffects.swift` - ‚úÖ FIXED
- `/Sources/Domain/Events/DomainEventDispatcher.swift`
- `/Sources/Features/OnboardingStepViews.swift`  
- `/Sources/Features/SettingsFeature.swift`
- `/Sources/Infrastructure/Cache/CacheConnection.swift`
- `/Sources/Infrastructure/Cache/CacheExtensions.swift`
- `/Sources/Infrastructure/Cache/CacheInvalidationDemo.swift`

**Issue Description**: Active merge conflict markers (`<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, `>>>>>>> Main`) exist throughout the codebase, indicating incomplete merge resolution.

**Example Conflict**:
```swift
<<<<<<< HEAD
        .accessibilityHint(actionTitle.map { "Action available: \($0)" } ?? "")
=======
        .accessibilityHint(actionTitle != nil ? "Action available: \(actionTitle ?? "")" : "")
>>>>>>> Main
```

### 2. **Syntax Errors and Malformed Code**
**Severity**: üö® **CRITICAL**  
**Impact**: Complete compilation failure

**Affected Files**:
- `/Sources/Domain/Events/DomainEventDispatcher.swift` - Extraneous closing braces
- `/Sources/Features/OnboardingStepViews.swift` - Expressions at top level, malformed structure
- `/Sources/Views/macOS/macOSAppView.swift` - Missing closing braces  
- `/Sources/Views/macOS/macOSMenuView.swift` - Statement separation errors
- `/Sources/Services/DocumentGenerationPerformanceMonitor.swift` - Expected declaration errors

**Example Errors**:
```
error: extraneous '}' at top level
error: expressions are not allowed at the top level  
error: expected '}' at end of brace statement
error: consecutive statements on a line must be separated by ';'
```

### 3. **Build System Failures**
**Current Build Status**: ‚ùå **FAILING**
```bash
swift build
# Results in: error: emit-module command failed with exit code 1
```

**Root Causes**:
1. Git merge conflicts preventing compilation
2. Syntax errors in core application files
3. Missing closing braces and malformed Swift syntax
4. Source control integrity issues

   - Choose appropriate resolution for each conflict
   - Validate syntax after each resolution

2. **Fix Syntax Errors**  
   - Repair malformed Swift code structures
   - Add missing closing braces
   - Fix statement separation issues
   - Validate compilation for each file

3. **Source Control Audit**
   - Investigate how merge conflicts entered main branch
   - Review recent commit history for integrity
   - Establish proper merge conflict resolution procedures

### Phase 2: **BUILD VALIDATION**
1. Execute `swift build` successfully
2. Run `swift package clean && swift package resolve`  
3. Validate all targets compile without errors

### Phase 3: **RESUME QA TESTING**
1. Execute comprehensive test suite
2. Address any test failures from GREEN‚ÜíQA transition
3. Validate MediaManagementFeature implementation
4. Generate final QA report
