# Better-Auth Assessment for AIKO Government Security Compliance

**Date**: July 15, 2025  
**Task**: 5.1 - Better-Auth Assessment and Planning  
**Duration**: Week 1-2  
**Priority**: CRITICAL for government compliance

## 3. Technical Integration Analysis

### SwiftUI/TCA Architecture Compatibility

```swift
// Better-Auth SDK Integration Pattern
struct AuthenticationFeature: Reducer {
    struct State: Equatable {
        var authState: BetterAuthState
        var isAuthenticated: Bool
        var userProfile: UserProfile?
        var mfaRequired: Bool
    }
    
    enum Action: Equatable {
        case login(credentials: Credentials)
        case logout
        case refreshToken
        case handleMFA(code: String)
        case biometricAuth
    }
}
```

### SDK Integration Points
1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Login/Logout handlers
   - Token refresh mechanism
   - MFA challenge/response

2. **Session Management**
   - Token storage in Keychain
   - Automatic refresh logic
   - Session persistence

3. **Offline Support**
   - Local credential caching
   - Offline validation logic
   - Queue for sync operations

                    │   Storage    │
                    └──────────────┘
```

### Security Layers
1. **Network Layer**: TLS 1.3, Certificate pinning
2. **Application Layer**: OAuth 2.0/OIDC, JWT tokens
3. **Device Layer**: Biometric auth, Secure Enclave
4. **Data Layer**: AES-256 encryption, Keychain protection

## 5. Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| SDK integration complexity | Medium | High | Phased implementation, thorough testing |
| Performance impact | Low | Medium | Optimize token refresh, cache strategies |
| Offline sync conflicts | Medium | Medium | Conflict resolution protocols |

### Compliance Risks
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Incomplete audit trails | Low | Critical | Comprehensive logging framework |
| MFA bypass vulnerabilities | Low | Critical | Multiple MFA methods, fallback controls |
| Data isolation failures | Low | Critical | Rigorous tenant separation testing |
