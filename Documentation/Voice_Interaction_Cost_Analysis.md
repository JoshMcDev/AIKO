# Voice Interaction Cost Analysis for AIKO

**Date**: January 15, 2025  
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive cost analysis for implementing real-time voice interaction capabilities in AIKO using OpenAI's APIs, comparing the new Realtime API against traditional STT→LLM→TTS pipelines.

## Cost Comparison

### Option 1: OpenAI Realtime API (gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview)

The Realtime API provides ultra-low latency voice interactions with native speech understanding.

| Component | Cost | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Audio Input | $0.06/minute | Voice input processing |
| Audio Output | $0.24/minute | Voice response generation |
| **Total per minute** | **$0.30** | Combined input/output |

**Monthly Cost Projections:**
- Light use (15 min/day): ~$135/month
- Moderate use (30 min/day): ~$270/month
- Heavy use (60 min/day): ~$540/month

**Advantages:**
- Ultra-low latency (< 300ms)
- Natural conversation flow
- Handles interruptions gracefully
- No transcription errors
- Native voice understanding

**Disadvantages:**
- Higher cost
- Limited model options
- Requires WebSocket implementation

### Option 2: Traditional Pipeline (STT→LLM→TTS)

Sequential processing using separate APIs for each step.

| Component | Cost | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Whisper STT | $0.006/minute | Speech-to-text |
| GPT-4o-mini Input | ~$0.0003/request | ~200 tokens avg |
| GPT-4o-mini Output | ~$0.0012/response | ~200 tokens avg |
| TTS Standard | ~$0.015/response | ~1000 chars avg |
| TTS HD | ~$0.030/response | ~1000 chars avg |
| **Total (Standard)** | **~$0.022/minute** | With standard TTS |
| **Total (HD)** | **~$0.037/minute** | With HD TTS |

**Monthly Cost Projections (Standard TTS):**
- Light use (15 min/day): ~$10/month
- Moderate use (30 min/day): ~$20/month
- Heavy use (60 min/day): ~$40/month

**Monthly Cost Projections (HD TTS):**
- Light use (15 min/day): ~$17/month
- Moderate use (30 min/day): ~$33/month
- Heavy use (60 min/day): ~$67/month

**Advantages:**
- 10-15x cheaper than Realtime API
- More model flexibility
- Can use different models for different tasks
- Easier to implement fallbacks

**Disadvantages:**
- Higher latency (1-3 seconds total)
- Less natural conversation flow
- Potential transcription errors
- Requires managing multiple API calls

## Implementation Architecture

### 1. User Settings Schema

```swift
struct VoiceInteractionSettings {
    var isEnabled: Bool = false
    var mode: VoiceMode = .traditional
    var ttsQuality: TTSQuality = .standard
    var dailyLimitMinutes: Int = 30
    var monthlyBudgetUSD: Double = 50.0
    var warningThreshold: Double = 0.8
    
    enum VoiceMode {
        case realtime     // OpenAI Realtime API
        case traditional  // STT→LLM→TTS pipeline
    }
    
    enum TTSQuality {
        case standard    // $15/1M chars
        case hd         // $30/1M chars
    }
}
```

### 2. Cost Tracking System

```swift
actor VoiceUsageTracker {
    private var dailyUsage: TimeInterval = 0
    private var monthlyUsage: TimeInterval = 0
    private var estimatedCost: Double = 0
    
    func trackUsage(duration: TimeInterval, mode: VoiceMode, quality: TTSQuality) async {
        // Update usage statistics
        // Calculate costs based on mode
        // Check against limits
        // Trigger warnings if needed
    }
}
```

### 3. Implementation Priorities

1. **Phase 1: Traditional Pipeline** (Lower Risk, Lower Cost)
   - Implement Whisper STT integration
   - Add streaming LLM responses
   - Integrate TTS with quality options
   - Add basic usage tracking

2. **Phase 2: Realtime API** (Premium Feature)
   - WebSocket connection management
   - Audio streaming implementation
   - Interruption handling
   - Fallback to traditional pipeline

## Cost Control Features

### 1. Usage Limits
- Daily minute limits
- Monthly budget caps
- Per-session limits
- Automatic cutoff when limits reached

### 2. User Notifications
- Usage approaching limit warnings
- Daily/monthly summaries
- Cost projections
- Mode recommendations based on usage

### 3. Adaptive Behavior
- Automatic quality reduction near limits
- Switch from Realtime to Traditional
- Suggest text mode when over budget
- Offline mode for practice/testing

## ROI Considerations

### Target User Segments

1. **Government Contractors** (High Value)
   - Time savings: 50-70% on document processing
   - Error reduction: 80% on form filling
   - Worth premium Realtime API cost

2. **Small Businesses** (Cost Sensitive)
   - Traditional pipeline recommended
   - Optional HD voice for presentations
   - Budget controls essential

3. **Enterprise** (Feature Rich)
   - Both options available
   - Department-level budgets
   - Usage analytics required

## Recommendations

1. **Default Configuration**
   - Traditional pipeline with standard TTS
   - 30 minutes daily limit
   - $50 monthly budget cap

2. **Premium Tier**
   - Realtime API access
   - HD TTS option
   - 60 minutes daily limit
   - $200 monthly budget cap

3. **Implementation Priority**
   - Start with traditional pipeline (Q1 2025)
   - Add Realtime API for premium users (Q2 2025)
   - A/B test pricing models (Q3 2025)

## Technical Requirements

### Traditional Pipeline
- Streaming STT support
- Response chunking for LLM
- Audio buffer management
- Error handling and retry logic

### Realtime API
- WebSocket client implementation
- Audio codec support (Opus/PCM)
- Bidirectional streaming
- Connection state management
- Automatic reconnection

## Security Considerations

1. **Audio Data**
   - No local storage of voice recordings
   - Encrypted transmission only
   - User consent for voice processing

2. **API Keys**
   - Secure key storage in Keychain
   - Separate keys for each service
   - Key rotation support

3. **Privacy**
   - Clear data retention policies
   - GDPR compliance
   - User data deletion options

## Conclusion

The traditional STT→LLM→TTS pipeline offers the best cost-effectiveness for most users at ~$0.022-0.037 per minute, while the Realtime API at $0.30/minute provides premium low-latency experiences for users who need natural, real-time conversations.

Implementing both options with clear cost indicators and controls will allow users to choose based on their needs and budget, making voice interaction accessible to all AIKO users while providing premium options for those who need them.
