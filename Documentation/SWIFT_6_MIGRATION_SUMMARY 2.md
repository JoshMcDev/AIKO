## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture Achievements

### ‚úÖ Triple Architecture Success

The migration successfully implemented a clean three-layer architecture:

1. **AikoCompat**: Sendable-safe wrappers for third-party dependencies
2. **AppCore**: Platform-agnostic business logic (78 compilation units)
3. **Platform Modules**: iOS and macOS specific implementations

**Impact**: Eliminated 153+ platform conditionals, dramatically improved maintainability.

### ‚úÖ Type Conflict Resolution

Successfully resolved complex type conflicts between:
- `AppCore.Acquisition` (business logic)
- `CoreData Acquisition` (persistence layer)

**Solution**: Systematic typealias strategy and explicit module qualification.

### ‚úÖ Concurrency Patterns

Established proven patterns for:
- Actor-based data access
- Sendable wrapper for third-party dependencies
- Module-by-module migration strategy
- Clean actor boundary definition
