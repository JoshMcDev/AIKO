# TDD Rubric: Comprehensive File & Media Management Suite

**Generated**: 2025-07-23  
**Task**: Comprehensive File & Media Management Suite  
**Based on**: Enhanced PRD with AIKO Codebase Analysis  
**Architecture Foundation**: TCA + Actor-based Concurrency  

## Measures of Effectiveness (MoE)

| # | Objective | Metric | Target |
|---|-----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Universal Media Capture | File types supported (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, RTF, PNG, JPEG, HEIC) | 8+ formats with validation |
| 2 | Seamless TCA Integration | MediaManagementFeature follows DocumentScannerFeature patterns | 100% architectural compliance |
| 3 | Actor-Based Concurrency | MediaProcessingEngine implements BatchProcessor patterns | Swift 6 strict concurrency compliance |
| 4 | Session Management | MediaSession extends ScanSession patterns with auto-save | Session persistence with error recovery |
| 5 | Progress Tracking | Real-time progress updates through ProgressBridge | AsyncStream integration with existing infrastructure |
| 6 | Form Auto-Population | Media metadata integration with existing OCR pipeline | Seamless content extraction and mapping |
| 7 | Universal Access | GlobalMediaFeature accessible from all 19 app screens | Consistent floating action button access |
| 8 | Client Implementation | All MediaManagementClients interfaces fully implemented | FilePickerClient, PhotoLibraryClient, CameraClient, ScreenshotClient |

## Measures of Performance (MoP)

| # | Behavior under test | Metric | Pass rule |
|---|---------------------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Media selection initiation | Time from tap to selection UI | < 100ms (GlobalScanFeature standard) |
| 2 | Photo capture response | Time from capture tap to preview | < 200ms (DocumentScannerFeature standard) |
| 3 | File validation speed | Document validation up to 10MB | < 500ms with error messaging |
| 4 | Progress update latency | Real-time progress streaming | < 50ms (ProgressBridge standard) |
| 5 | Form integration speed | Metadata extraction to form mapping | < 1s for media content analysis |
| 6 | Memory efficiency | Peak memory during batch operations | < 100MB (BatchProcessor standard) |
| 7 | Concurrent operations | MediaProcessingEngine batch processing | Max 3 concurrent (BatchProcessor pattern) |
| 8 | Image optimization | Storage efficiency with quality preservation | 60-80% size reduction without quality loss |
| 9 | Session auto-save | MediaSession persistence frequency | < 200ms saves with no UI blocking |
| 10 | Error recovery time | Recovery from processing failures | < 500ms with user notification |

## Definition of Success

The Comprehensive File & Media Management Suite successfully extends AIKO's proven DocumentScannerFeature architecture to provide universal media capture, processing, and integration capabilities. Success is achieved when all MediaManagementClients interfaces are fully implemented with TCA compliance, actor-based concurrency maintains thread safety, performance targets are consistently met across all operations, and seamless integration with existing form auto-population workflow is demonstrated. The solution must leverage established patterns (ScanSession, ProgressBridge, BatchProcessor) while providing universal access from all 19 app screens and maintaining the <200ms interaction standards established by the DocumentScannerFeature.

## Definition of Done

### Architectural Compliance
* [ ] MediaManagementFeature implements TCA with @ObservableState and hierarchical actions
* [ ] MediaSession extends ScanSession patterns with auto-save and error recovery
* [ ] MediaProcessingEngine actor follows BatchProcessor concurrency patterns
