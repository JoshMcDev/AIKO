## Recent Enhancements (January 16, 2025)

### Pattern Recognition Algorithm Improvements

1. **Recency Calculation** - Implemented in `PatternRecognitionAlgorithm.swift`
   - Exponential decay based on interaction age
   - Position-weighted scoring for recent interactions
   - Configurable max age window (30 days default)

2. **Consistency Calculation** - Implemented in `PatternRecognitionAlgorithm.swift`
   - Statistical analysis of time intervals between interactions
   - Coefficient of variation for consistency scoring
   - Exponential transformation for intuitive scoring

3. **Temporal Pattern Analysis** - Enhanced in `TemporalPatternAnalyzer`
   - Daily consistency tracking with streak detection
   - Recency bonus calculation with exponential decay
   - Multi-factor confidence scoring (frequency, consistency, recency)

## Build Status

All components build successfully with 0 warnings and 0 errors using Swift 6.

```bash
Build complete! (11.41s)
```

## Next Steps

With Phase 2 complete, the next priority according to `Project_Tasks.md` is:

**Task 5: Better-Auth Implementation for Government Security Compliance**
- Location: Phase 4 (Form Intelligence & Automation)
- Priority: CRITICAL for government compliance
- Timeline: 10-12 weeks
- Features: FISMA/FedRAMP compliance, biometric auth, multi-tenant isolation, offline-first authentication
