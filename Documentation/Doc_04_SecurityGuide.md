# AIKO Security Guide

## Security Overview

AIKO implements defense-in-depth security measures to protect sensitive federal acquisition data and ensure compliance with government security requirements.

## Authentication

### Biometric Authentication
- Face ID/Touch ID required on app launch
- Fallback to device passcode if biometric fails
- Re-authentication after 15 minutes of inactivity
- Session invalidation on app backgrounding

### Implementation
```swift
// BiometricAuthenticationService
public func authenticate() async throws -> Bool {
    let context = LAContext()
    let reason = "Authenticate to access AIKO"
    return try await context.evaluatePolicy(.deviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometrics, localizedReason: reason)
}
```

## Data Protection

### Encryption at Rest
- Core Data encrypted using `NSFileProtectionComplete`
- Documents encrypted with AES-256
- Keychain storage for sensitive credentials
- No plaintext storage of user data

### Encryption in Transit
- TLS 1.3 for all API communications
- Certificate pinning for critical endpoints
- No HTTP connections allowed (ATS enforced)

## API Security

### Key Management
- API keys stored in Keychain only
- Never hardcoded in source
- Environment-specific key rotation
- Separate keys for dev/staging/production

### Request Security
```swift
// Example secure request
var request = URLRequest(url: endpoint)
request.setValue("Bearer \(token)", forHTTPHeaderField: "Authorization")
request.httpMethod = "POST"
request.httpBody = try JSONEncoder().encode(payload)
```

## Compliance Requirements

### NIST 800-53 Controls
- AC-2: Account Management
- AC-3: Access Enforcement
- AU-2: Audit Events
- SC-8: Transmission Confidentiality
- SC-28: Protection of Information at Rest

### FedRAMP Considerations
- Continuous monitoring
- Vulnerability scanning
- Security assessment procedures
- Incident response plan

## Secure Coding Practices

### Input Validation
- All user inputs sanitized
- PDF/Word file validation before parsing
- Size limits on file uploads (50MB)
- Content type verification

### Error Handling
- No sensitive data in error messages
- Generic user-facing error responses
- Detailed logging for debugging (sanitized)
- Crash reporting without PII

## Security Checklist

### Development
- [ ] Code review for security issues
