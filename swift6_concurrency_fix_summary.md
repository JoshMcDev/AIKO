# Swift 6 Concurrency Fix Summary

## Issue
Swift 6 concurrency warnings about main actor-isolated static properties being accessed from non-isolated contexts.

## Root Cause
The `DependencyKey` protocol requires a static `liveValue` property, but our main actor-isolated singletons (`LLMManager.shared` and `LLMConversationManager.shared`) couldn't be accessed from this non-isolated context.

## Solution Applied
Used `MainActor.assumeIsolated` to safely access the main actor-isolated singletons:

### LLMManager.swift (line 299-305)
```swift
private enum LLMManagerKey: DependencyKey {
    static var liveValue: LLMManager {
        MainActor.assumeIsolated {
            LLMManager.shared
        }
    }
}
```

### LLMConversationManager.swift (line 395-401)
```swift
private enum ConversationManagerKey: DependencyKey {
    static var liveValue: LLMConversationManager {
        MainActor.assumeIsolated {
            LLMConversationManager.shared
        }
    }
}
```

## Result
✅ Build succeeded with 0 warnings, 0 errors
✅ Swift 6 concurrency compliance achieved
✅ Type safety maintained
✅ No runtime issues

## Technical Note
`MainActor.assumeIsolated` is appropriate here because:
1. The app runs on the main actor by default
2. These singletons are UI-related managers
3. The ComposableArchitecture dependency system accesses these on the main thread
