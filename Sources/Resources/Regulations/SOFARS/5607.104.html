            <u class="ph u">FAR 7.102(a)</u>
         </a>, acquisition planning is required for all acquisitions. Acquisition planning is paramount and should begin as soon as the requirement is identified, preferably well in advance of the fiscal year in which contract award or order placement is necessary. In addition to the DFARS thresholds for a written acquisition plan, an acquisition plan is required for the following actions. The detail to which the plan is developed will be determined by the complexity of the acquisition and the dollar threshold.</p>

            <u class="ph u">DFARS 207.103</u>
         </a>, a simplified acquisition plan is required to document pre-award decisions and risk assessment information. Alternate contract documentation such as memorandum for record, business clearance memorandum, or other documentation may be used in lieu of a standalone acquisition plan. At a minimum, documentation should address the following as applicable: market research considerations (competition, SB, commercial alternatives, pre-existing contract vehicles), and the appropriate contract type.</p>

      <p class="p List2" id="SOFARS_5607.104__gijFKM">(4) Single Acquisition Management Plan (SAMP) – Describes a program's overall program strategy per the USSOCOM D 70-1.

         </a>, the program manager, or other official responsible for the program, has overall responsibility for acquisition planning. For smaller dollar and less complex acquisitions, the person responsible for developing the acquisition plan and milestones will be the Contracting Officer.
