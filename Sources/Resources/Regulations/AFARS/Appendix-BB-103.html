      <p class="p Normal">Questions in this checklist should be used by office
            chiefs/directors who are deployed into a theater of operations and are supporting
            contingency missions. The term “contingency contracting” means contracting support
            provided in response to a declared contingency operation in accordance with 10 USC
            101(a)(13) (see also FAR subpart 2.1, Definitions). The support may be provided in a
            mature or immature operational environment, and may be long term or short term. Office
            chiefs/directors shall use these questions to test internal controls for contingency
            contracting functions. Each office chief/director shall complete and submit to his/her
            respective senior contracting official (SCO) at the midpoint during the office
            chief/director’s tour. The SCO will provide feedback to the office chief/director
            relating to the effectiveness of key internal controls. Prior to redeployment, the
            office chief/director shall complete and submit a final checklist to the SCO. The final
            checklist will be retained in the continuity book to serve as a baseline for the next
            office chief/director. In addition, information obtained using the checklist will be
            addressed in the SCO’s annual statement of assurance as prescribed by Army Regulation
            11-2.</p>
