          </a> is the mandatory
source for all purchases of commercial-off-the-shelf software,
desktops, notebook computers, video teleconferencing equipment, and
other commercial Information Technology (IT) equipment (e.g.,
routers, servers, peripherals, regardless of dollar value). CHESS
is the mandatory source for all Army IT purchases, except for the
Air National Guard, which is exempt from the CHESS requirement and
must purchase IT through <a class="xref" href="https://www.afadvantage.gov/" target="_blank">
            <u class="ph u">Air Force Advantage /
GSA-2GIT</u>
          </a> to retain IT compatibility. Per AFARS 5108.7403,
before procuring commercial software outside of the CHESS
contracts, the contracting officer or contract ordering official CH
must ensure that the requiring activity obtains a waiver. Any IT
hardware or software purchase made outside of CHESS requires a
Statement of Non-availability (SoNA). See AFARS 5139.101-90(a) and
AR 25-1.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. All desktops and notebooks must be purchased
during one of the Consolidated Buy ordering periods that occur
three times annually (Oct/Jan, Feb/May, and Jun/Sep). Consolidated
Buy exception memos are prepared by the requiring activity and are
approved by an O6/GS-15 (or equivalent) within the requiring
activity and must remain a part of the transaction document file.
An exception memo example is available at <a class="xref" href="https://chess.army.mil/Content/Page/CB_EXPT" target="_blank">

        </p>
        <p class="p List1">c. IT hardware or software purchases require an
Army Deputy Chief of Staff (DCS), G-6 approved Information
Technology Approval System (ITAS) Memorandum. CHs must include the
ITAS Approval Memorandum in the transaction file along with all
other supporting documentation. Supporting documentation must
include documentation submitted with the ITAS approval request such
as a CHESS SoNA. The CHESS website provides information concerning
ITAS approvals. CHs may also consult their local command for
guidance. The ITAS Approval website is located at <a class="xref" href="https://cprobe.army.mil/enterprise-portal/web/itas/home" target="_blank">

        </p>
        <p class="p List1">d. Any IT hardware or software purchase made
outside of CHESS requires a SoNA. A SoNA is a notice that a
particular product is not currently available through a CHESS
contract. It is not a waiver to purchase, nor does it authorize use
on the Army network. For detailed instructions on SoNA requirements
and how to obtain a SoNA, see <a class="xref" href="https://chess.army.mil/Content/Page/SONA" target="_blank">
