      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">A/OPCs and CPMs must complete monthly reviews within IOD to
promote and measure compliance with internal controls and provide
reasonable assurance of the effectiveness of these controls to
mitigate program risk. A/OPCs and CPMs are required to complete
monthly reviews each billing cycle. IOD automatically assigns and
generates monthly reviews, which become available for completion
once all transactions for that agent and billing cycle have been
closed. Monthly reviews are considered complete only if 100 percent
of all cases selected during the billing cycle have been
closed.</p>
        <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">A/OPC Monthly Review</strong>. Level 4
A/OPCs must complete this review once all BOs have completed all
cases assigned to them. A/OPCs are required to initiate and conduct
a Monthly A/OPC Review at the end of each billing cycle. To
complete the A/OPC Monthly Review, you must generate the Monthly
A/OPC Review Report to assess the key internal controls. Within 30
days of the cycle end date, A/OPCs must complete the following
actions:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Validate all DM cases (except those in a
deployed or exempt status) are closed.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Generate the Monthly A/OPC Review Report in IOD
and assess the key internal controls included on the report. Key
GPC program controls are calculated and displayed in the Monthly
A/OPC Review Report generated by the DM tool. See the <a class="xref" href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/asda/dpc/ce/pc/docs/smart-pay/Monthly_Report_Guide.pdf" target="_blank">Monthly
A/OPC Review Report Guide</a>, which addresses data sources,
calculation methodologies, and report format.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Perform a summary assessment that includes 100
percent of all transactions not flagged by the DM tool to (1)
ensure awareness of purchasing activity within their hierarchy and
(2) identify purchasing and behavior patterns not otherwise
identified by the DM tool (e.g., patterns that span multiple card
accounts and/or MAs) or that may otherwise require A/OPC action.
Access Online Transaction Detail reports are available for
performing these reviews.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Ensure a DM case is created for each Finding
and Determination they independently identify (i.e., not flagged by
the DM tool).</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) Document completion of the review by completing
and certifying the A/OPC Monthly Checklist. Upload the Monthly
A/OPC Review Report in the Messages tab of the A/OPC Monthly
Review. If a Level 4 A/OPC has multiple agents, they can run one
report for all agents and upload it to the top-listed level.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">OA/OPC Monthly Review</strong>. Level 3
A/OPCs must complete this review once all Level 4 A/OPCs assigned
to them have completed their monthly reviews. The Level 3 A/OPC
reviews the internal controls summary for their program and concurs
with the findings, determinations, and any corrective actions
planned or taken. Level 3 A/OPCs are also required to spot-check
the monthly reviews conducted by their Level 4 A/OPCs. Level 3
A/OPCs will complete monthly reviews within 10 calendar days of
their Level 4 A/OPCs’ completion.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">CPM Monthly Review</strong>. CPMs
(Level 2 A/OPCs) must complete this review once all Level 3 A/OPCs
assigned to them have completed their monthly reviews.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. If the monthly review cannot be completed
(i.e., is deferred) using the DM tool because the BO and/or A/OPC
and their alternates are deployed or exempt and have insufficient
access to the application, the OA/OPC may then mark the case
“Closed – Not Reviewed” in the DM tool and
approve completion of the monthly review cycle. The BO and/or A/OPC
will complete the monthly review manually and then update the audit
tool upon completion of the deployment.</p>
