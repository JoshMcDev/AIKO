      <p class="p">While the specific evaluation processes and tasks will vary
between source selections, the basic objective remains constant
– <strong class="ph b">
            <em class="ph i">to provide the SSA with the information needed
to make an informed and reasoned selection.</em>
          </strong> To this
end result, the evaluators will identify strengths, weaknesses,
deficiencies, risks, and uncertainties applicable to each proposal.
The process of identifying these findings is crucial to the
competitive range determination, the conduct of meaningful
discussions and debriefings, and the tradeoff analysis described in
the Source Selection Decision Document (SSDD).</p>
      <p class="p">
          <strong class="ph b">
            <em class="ph i">Reminder:</em>
          </strong> The SSEB <strong class="ph b">
            <em class="ph i">shall
not</em>
          </strong> perform comparative analysis of proposals or make
source selection recommendations <u class="ph u">unless</u> requested by the SSA
<em class="ph i">(Reference DoD Source Selection Procedures 1.4.4.4.3).</em>
        </p>
      <p class="p">While the below steps are identified in a linear manner, some of
the process is iterative and some steps may be accomplished
concurrently. Except where noted, these steps apply to the
evaluation of both the cost and non-cost factors. The groups
responsible for evaluating past performance, other non-cost
factors, and cost/price normally perform their evaluations in
parallel. The PCO and SSEB Chairperson shall ensure that the
evaluation of each proposal is performed in a fair, integrated and
comprehensive manner.</p>
      <p class="p"> <strong class="ph b">
            <em class="ph i">Best Practice:</em>
          </strong>
          <em class="ph i">Identify
acquisition teams at the requirements development phase and provide
comprehensive training on the entire process, from acquisition
planning through source selection decision. Provide SSEB training
covering the final RFP and SSP approximately one to two weeks prior
to receipt of proposals.</em>
        </p>
      <p class="p">
          <strong class="ph b">Step 1: Conduct SSEB Training <em class="ph i">–</em>
          </strong>
Prior to receipt of proposals, each evaluator must become familiar
with all pertinent documents (e.g., the RFP and SSP). Source
selection evaluation training shall be provided/required for each
evaluation and conducted by the PCO, at the PCO’s request,
and under their supervision; the evaluation training may be
conducted by another qualified source selection expert or an agency
team. Training shall include an overview of the source selection
process, required documents, and include a detailed focus on how to
properly document rationale for the assigned rating, as well as the
assessment of each offeror’s proposal’s strengths,
weaknesses, uncertainties, risks, and deficiencies. Designated
Legal Counsel is recommended to assist in the source selection
evaluation training as well, providing content relating to ethics,
procurement integrity, the protection of source selection
information, and signing of non-disclosure agreements.</p>
      <p class="p">The training will be based on the contents of the DoD Source
Selection Procedures and this supplement. Defense Acquisition
University (DAU) training may be useful and can be required for
SSEB members at the PCO or SSA’s discretion. Ensuring all
SSEB members have current, and a standardized level of training is
a priority and is especially crucial when evaluators have no
previous or varying levels of prior source selection evaluation
experience, as is frequently the case. Specific organization or
requirement information should be included as part of the initial
SSEB training.</p>
      <p class="p">
          <strong class="ph b">Step 2: Perform Initial Screening of Proposals
<em class="ph i">–</em>
          </strong> Upon receipt of proposals, the PCO or
designee shall conduct an initial screening to ensure
offerors’ proposals comply with the RFP instructions for
submission of all required information, including electronic media,
in the quantities and format specified in the RFP. The screening of
prime and major subcontractor names to ensure no conflict of
interest for the SST is strongly recommended, especially if
contract advisors are used as part of the evaluation team. Figure
3-1 is an extract of a sample proposal screening checklist that may
be used to accomplish this initial screening and should be tailored
to match the specific proposal submission requirements of the
RFP.</p>

<em class="ph i">–</em>
          </strong> Evaluators will independently read and
evaluate the offeror’s proposal against the criteria
identified in the RFP and SSP, document their initial evaluation
findings (e.g., strengths, weaknesses, deficiencies, risks, and
uncertainties), and draft proposed evaluation notices (ENs) for
each finding to be addressed, ensuring resulting narrative is sound
and meaningful.</p>

          <strong class="ph b">–</strong> If information is required to enhance the
government’s understanding of the proposal, the PCO may
request amplifying or other relevant information from the offeror
by means of the clarification or communication process (see FAR
15.306). The PCO should engage the legal advisor prior to
conducting this process. <em class="ph i">(See Figure 3-3 for a detailed
discussion of the differences between clarifications,
communications, and discussions.)</em>

          <strong class="ph b">Step 6: Assign Ratings for Non-Cost Evaluation Factors
When Using the Tradeoff Process </strong>– At this
point, the evaluators may or may not individually assign ratings to
each evaluation factor or subfactor for which they are responsible.
At a minimum, each evaluation team (factor, subfactor) must convene
to discuss the offeror’s proposal. The purpose of the
discussion is to share their views on the offeror’s
strengths, weaknesses, deficiencies, risks, and uncertainties
related to their assigned evaluation factor(s) / subfactor(s) and
to reach a team consensus on findings and rating as
appropriate.</p>

          </strong> A simple
averaging of the individual evaluation results does not constitute
consensus.</p>
      <p class="p"> In exceptional cases where the evaluators are unable to
reach consensus without unreasonably delaying the source selection
process, the evaluation report shall include the majority
conclusion and the dissenting view(s) in the form of a minority
opinion, each with supporting rationale. The report must be briefed

          <strong class="ph b">Step 8: Prepare Summary Evaluation Reports for Each
Factor <em class="ph i">–</em>
          </strong> Each Factor Chair will prepare a
summary report for their respective factor which provides a
discussion of their associated findings. These reports will help
form the Summary SSEB Evaluation Report and must be prepared at
each phase of the process: initial, interim, and final
evaluations.</p>
      <p class="p">
          <strong class="ph b">Step 9: Prepare a Summary SSEB Evaluation Report
<em class="ph i">–</em>
          </strong> The final step is for the SSEB
Chairperson to prepare a summary report for each proposal that
includes the evaluated price, the rating for each evaluation factor

(strengths, weaknesses, deficiencies, risks, and uncertainties). A
Summary SSEB Evaluation Report must be prepared at each stage of
the process: initial, interim, and final evaluations.</p>

Analysis</em>
        </p>
      <p class="p">The following are some general evaluation guidelines and
recommendations for evaluating cost/price:</p>
      <p class="p"> The Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGE) may play
a key role in cost/price analysis. It serves as a benchmark for
price analysis and in cost realism and may also serve as a
benchmark for individual cost elements. The IGE must contain a
rationale of how it was developed (e.g., what estimating tools were
used and what assumptions were made) in order to properly evaluate
cost/price.</p>
      <p class="p"> With the approval of the SSEB Chairperson and the PCO,
the cost/price evaluators should coordinate with the non-cost
factor evaluation team leads, as necessary, to ensure consistency
between the proposed costs/prices and other portions of the
proposal. This interchange between SSEB factor teams is part of the
initial validation exercise and should be continued throughout the
evaluation process to ensure that interrelationships are promptly
identified, and the evaluation findings reflect their recognition.
For example, the technical evaluation may reveal areas where each
offeror’s approach is inadequate or its resourcing
unrealistic, given the proposed approach. The technical evaluators
and the cost evaluators should crosswalk technical deficiencies and
weaknesses and their impact on cost to ensure an adequate
understanding of risks and to ensure proper cost realism
adjustments can be made to the proposed costs, if applicable.</p>
      <p class="p"> When conducting price analysis, consider not only the
total price, including options, but also the prices for the
individual Contract Line Items to ensure they are not unbalanced.
Unbalanced pricing exists when the price of one or more contract
line items is significantly over or understated as indicated by the
application of cost/price analysis techniques. The PCO, with
concurrence of the SSA, if permitted by the RFP may reject the
offer if they determine that this poses an unacceptable risk to the
government. For more information on unbalanced pricing, see FAR
15.404-1(g).</p>
      <p class="p"> For fixed-price contracts, the evaluation can be as
simple as consideration of adequate price competition/comparison of
proposed prices received in response to the solicitation and
ensuring prices are fair and reasonable.</p>
      <p class="p"> Pricing from proposals with marginal or unacceptable
technical ratings should only be included in comparison of proposed
prices after determining that the offeror included all necessary
requirements in the proposed price (for example, a proposal with a
significant weakness or deficiency based on a missing item,
process, or labor category in the technical proposal is likely to
have omitted the same in the proposed price). If only one proposal
is determined to be technically acceptable, adequate price
competition should not be used as the sole basis for determining
price reasonableness.</p>
      <p class="p"> For cost-reimbursement contracts, you must analyze the
offerors’ estimated costs for both realism and
reasonableness. In a competitive environment, the cost realism
analysis enables you to determine each offeror’s probable
cost of performance. This precludes an award decision based on an
overly optimistic cost estimate.</p>

determining/verifying the relevancy of a contract referenced in an
offeror’s past performance is to locate and review the
contract and requirements in Electronic Document Access (EDA).

Wide Area Workflow (WAWF) suite of tools located on the Procurement
Integrated Enterprise Environment (PIEE) site <a class="xref" href="https://piee.eb.mil/" target="_blank">https://piee.eb.mil/</a>. To ensure
your ability to access contract records, complete this process well
in advance of the start of source selection. . <em class="ph i">(Reference DD

          <strong class="ph b">Sources of Past Performance
Information<em class="ph i">.</em>
          </strong> Where possible, use past performance
information available from government-wide and agency-wide
databases. Use of such information will help to expedite and
streamline the evaluation process.</p>
      <p class="p"> If possible, contact two points of contact on each
contract effort selected for in-depth review. The PCOs, SBPs, CORs,
Fee Determining Officials, and program management office
representatives are often excellent sources of information.</p>
      <p class="p"> If multiple points of contact are providing past
performance information on contract (for example, the PCO, SBP, and
PM), arrange for submission of consolidated input from these
sources. This may remove the need for the evaluation team to
reconcile variances in past performance information submitted.</p>
      <p class="p"> In assessing the feedback, pay particular attention to
the source of that feedback and their familiarity with the
requirements of the contract being assessed. For example, end users
may be unfamiliar with the contract requirements or certain issues
and resolution arising from contract performance may not be
apparent to them.</p>
      <p class="p"> The agency has an obligation to consider information
that has a bearing on an offeror’s past performance if the
SST is aware of (or should have been aware of) the information. For
example, an agency may not ignore contract performance by an
offeror involving the same agency, the same services, and/or the
same PCO, simply because an agency official fails to complete the
necessary assessments or documentation. Consult legal counsel on
how to address this type of information.</p>

          <strong class="ph b">Addressing Adverse Past Performance
Information<em class="ph i">.</em>
          </strong> When adverse past performance is
obtained, as appropriate, contact the respective point of contact
for that contract to obtain further information about the
circumstances surrounding the situation. Additionally, and when
practical, contact at least one other individual to get a second
perspective on the offeror’s performance on the subject
acquisition. Consider the context of the performance problems, any
mitigating circumstances, the number and severity of the problems,
the demonstrated effectiveness of corrective actions taken, and the
overall work record.</p>
      <p class="p" id="AFARS_Appendix-AA_3_1__Toc178607311">If there is
past performance information that adversely impacts an
offeror’s proposal assessment, provide the offeror an
opportunity to address any such information on which it has not had
a previous opportunity to comment. This opportunity may occur
during clarifications, communications, or discussions, depending
upon whether discussions are anticipated.</p>
      <p class="p" id="AFARS_Appendix-AA_3_1__Toc178607312">When
addressing adverse past performance information, identify the
contract, but do not identify the name of the individual who
provided the information. Summarize the problem(s) with sufficient
detail to give the offeror a reasonable opportunity to respond.</p>
      <p class="p">
          <strong class="ph b">NOTE:</strong> Past performance is considered a
responsibility-type determination for purposes of SBA’s
Certificate of Competency (COC) program, even if the next
acceptable offer is also from a small business (<em class="ph i">See FAR
19.601</em>). FAR 19.602-1(a) requires agencies to refer a finding
of non-responsibility to the SBA if the determination would
preclude award. Therefore, if the PCO refuses to consider a small
business concern for award after evaluating the concern's past
performance as a non-trade-off evaluation factor (e.g., a
pass/fail, go/no-go, or acceptable/unacceptable), the matter must
be referred to the SBA. Alternatively, when past performance will
be an evaluation factor in the trade-off process, SBA referral is
not required because the evaluation of past performance is part of
a comparative, best value evaluation and not a responsibility
determination.</p>

        </p>
      <p class="p">
          <strong class="ph b">The Army methodology for rating the small business
participation factor is to utilize the DoD Source Selection
Procedures rating scheme for Small Business Participation</strong>
          <em class="ph i">(See DoD Source Selection Procedures 3.1.4.1.2 – Table
6).</em> Solely relying on acceptable/unacceptable or pass/fail
rating schemes are the least preferred method of evaluating small
business participation in best value tradeoff source selections.
This rating scheme does not allow evaluators to give higher ratings
to offerors that significantly exceed the stated small business
goals or submit proof of binding agreements with small businesses
and therefore are discouraged.</p>
      <p class="p">Additionally, small business past performance should be
considered and is required in some cases (See FAR
15.304(c)(3)(ii)). In looking at small business past performance,
the government evaluates how well the offeror has performed in
achieving its small business goals. Remember that this should only
be evaluated for other than small businesses in assessing their
compliance with FAR 52.219-9. A tool regularly used by the
government is the electronic Subcontracting Reporting System
(eSRS).</p>
      <p class="p">
          <strong class="ph b">NOTE<em class="ph i">:</em>
          </strong> DFARS PGI 215.304 provides an
example that indicates evaluation of past performance compliance
within a separate small business participation factor. This may
instead be evaluated under the past performance factor,
<strong class="ph b">
            <em class="ph i">but not in both factors</em>
          </strong>.</p>
      <p class="p">Small business offerors (other than firms utilizing the HUBZone
price preference) proposing on unrestricted requirements are not
held to the requirements of FAR 52.219-14 Limitations on
Subcontracting because the clause is applicable to small business
set-aside procurements <u class="ph u">only</u>. However, small business
offerors should meet the small business participation factor goals
through any, or a combination of the following: performance as a
prime small business, performance as a joint venture, or small
business subcontracting.</p>
      <p class="p">DoD Source Selection Procedures 3.1.6 require the offeror to
include a commitment signed by both the offeror and the
subcontractor certifying that, if a contract is awarded resulting
from the proposal, the parties commit to joint performance as
proposed when subcontractor experience is submitted for
consideration as part of the proposal. If the signed commitment is
not fully executed by both parties and provided with the Past
Performance Proposal, subcontractor references will not be
evaluated or considered.</p>
