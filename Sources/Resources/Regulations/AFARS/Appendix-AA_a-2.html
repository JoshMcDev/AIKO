            <strong class="ph b">Notes to Figure A-1:</strong>
          </p>
          <p class="p">(1) The offeror may request the debriefing be delayed until
after contract award. When delayed, the debriefing shall include
all the information provided in a postaward debriefing.</p>
          <p class="p">(2) In the event either the government or offeror delays the
debriefing, the PCO must provide the debriefing within the
timeframe established for postaward debriefings.</p>
          <p class="p">(3) If an offeror submits an untimely request for debriefing,
the PCO may nonetheless conduct a debriefing if feasible. In such
case, inform the offeror the request is untimely.
<strong class="ph b">NOTE:</strong> If new information is provided during an
untimely debriefing, it may form the basis of a timely protest.
Therefore, obtain legal advice prior to providing an untimely
debriefing</p>
          <p class="p">(4) Do not count the day the offeror received the notice; start
with the next day. Consider sending the notice by mail with return
receipt requested or by electronic means (facsimile transmission or
e-mail) with immediate acknowledgment requested so that you can
easily establish the date the offeror received it.</p>
          <p class="p">(5) Includes such things as trade secrets; privileged or
confidential information, e.g., manufacturing processes and
techniques, commercial and financial information, and cost data;
and the names of individuals providing past performance
information. It does not include information otherwise available
without restriction to the government or public.</p>
          <p class="p">(6) If the element was significant enough to eliminate the
offeror from the competitive range, it is significant for
debriefing purposes. Include both positive and negative aspects of
the offeror’s proposal to help improve future proposals.</p>

Debriefing</u>
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p class="p">In a postaward debriefing, disclose the evaluation ratings of
the debriefed offeror and awardee to the subfactor level of
evaluation; and all significant weaknesses, weaknesses, strengths,
and deficiencies (if any) of the debriefed offeror’s
proposal.</p>
          <p class="p">Disclose the debriefed offeror’s total evaluated prices
and the awardee’s total evaluated cost/price (include unit
prices only if releasable under FOIA, but DO NOT disclose the
IGE).</p>
          <p class="p">Disclose a summary of the rationale for the contract award
decision. The rationale is contained in the SSA’s SSDD.
Evaluation information concerning the other unsuccessful offerors
and information not releasable under FOIA must be redacted prior to
release of an SSDD, ensuring no information listed in FAR 15.506(e)
is released.</p>
          <p class="p">For award of a contract in excess of $10 million and not in
excess of $100 million with a small business or nontraditional
defense contractor, the debrief must include an option for the
small business or nontraditional defense contractor to request a
redacted copy of the SSDD <em class="ph i">(Reference DFARS Subpart
215.506(d)(i))</em>.</p>
          <p class="p">For all other awards below $100M, consider furnishing the
debriefed offerors with a <strong class="ph b">
              <em class="ph i">redacted</em>
            </strong> copy
of the SSDD.</p>
          <p class="p">For award of a contract exceeding $100M, a redacted copy of the
SSDD is required to be furnished to offerors <em class="ph i">(Reference DFARS
Subpart 215.506(d)(ii)).</em>
          </p>
          <p class="p">Clearly indicate when the debriefing has been concluded. Formal
conclusion of the debriefing begins the protest window.</p>
