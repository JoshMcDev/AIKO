professional and personal self-development. Advance payments are
authorized under the TA Program in accordance with AR 621-5.

which equates to a commitment, but not as an obligation document.
Only AF Form 1227s generated in the Air Force Virtual Education
Center (AFVEC) will be utilized for TA payments.</p>

college or university. The academic degree</p>

        <p class="p">Cardholders may use the GPC to pay for academic degree training
approved by the appropriate authority indicated in AR 350-1.
Academic degree training requests, regardless of funding source
(career program or command), require approval by the Assistant
Secretary of the Army (Manpower and Reserve Affairs) (ASA
(M&amp;RA)). This does not apply to employees in Army-sponsored
Intern or Fellows programs. Employees must not circumvent the
academic degree training approval and funding process by submitting
requests for the approval of individual college courses, annotating
that such training is not part of an academic degree training
program.</p>
