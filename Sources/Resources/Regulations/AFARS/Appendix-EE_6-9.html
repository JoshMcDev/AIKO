   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">Payment Delinquency
Monitoring</strong>. A/OPCs must track managing account
certification after the end of the billing cycle and confirm
whether the payments processed. A/OPCs can use the Managing Account
Approval Status and Certification and Payment Report reports to
identify accounts that have not been certified. The servicing bank
may send reports of delinquencies and potential past due accounts.
A/OPCs can also use the Past Due report in the bank’s EAS to
identify delinquent accounts. Past due notices (delinquencies over
30 days) must be handled immediately. GPC stakeholders must work
together to research and correct any delinquency immediately.
Delinquencies that are 60 days past due should be suspended. The
Army goal is to pay all accounts on time. The Army maintains a zero
tolerance for any percentage of receivables over 180 days past
due.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. The A/OPC will monitor account certifications
and may suspend any account that is not certified within 5 business
days. If the A/OPC suspends an account, once the account is
certified, the A/OPC may reinstate the account. If the bank
suspends an account, once the account is certified and paid, the
account is automatically reinstated. The request to reinstate a
suspended account due to non- certification, must include an
explanation of the delay in certification and a plan to avoid
future delays. If the account has been suspended for late
certification more than once, any request to reinstate the account
must come from the activity responsible for the account.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. The Certifying Officer’s minimum
qualifications and eligibility are discussed in DoD FMR Volume 5,
Chapter 33. Certifying Officers are responsible for the accuracy of
payments, including designation of the proper appropriation(s) or
other funds certified to the paying office and disbursing officer.
To certify GPC invoices for payment by DFAS, the BO must be
appointed as and accept the responsibilities of a Certifying
Officer using the DD Form 577 generated in JAM. The BO certifies
the statement as the Certifying Officer, and the RM certifies the
funding in GFEBS/other.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Cardholder Statement Reconciliation and
Certification</strong>. The Army certifies invoices for payment
after all purchased items have been confirmed. This procedure is
called “Confirm and Pay.” Any transactions that cannot
be reconciled and approved for payment, will not be approved in the
bank’s EAS by the BO. ANG and certain other Army accounts
supporting the Air Force certify invoices for payment following the
“Pay and Confirm” model. Cardholders must match and
approve transactions throughout the month to ensure accuracy and
identify and resolve any funding errors. If a charged amount is
incorrect, the CH must contact the vendor to resolve the
discrepancy and may dispute the transaction, if necessary.
Cardholders must also upload transaction documentation throughout
the month to ensure BO visibility of purchase information. If the
statement is correct at the end of the billing cycle, the CH must
approve the statement within three business days of the billing
cycle end date. For Army agencies that do not utilize the bank's
EAS for monthly certification, per the DoD FMR, Vol 10 Chapter 23,
Figure 23-2, the CH must complete a monthly certification statement
as part of their reconciliation process.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. Cardholders are responsible for reconciling the
charges appearing on each statement for their GPC with receipts,
purchase log, and other supporting documentation. Reconciling a
card account involves the following key actions:</p>
      <p class="p List2">1) Review the transactions on the statement from
the card-issuing bank and match them to the purchase log. Note:
Transaction review and invoice obligation will be completed in only
one system (i.e., either the bank EAS or another waiver-approved
automated system, but never both). Component policy and procedures
will designate the automated system in which CHs will perform
review and obligation.</p>
      <p class="p List2">2) Reconcile/reallocate/dispute transactions, as
appropriate. For each transaction posted to the statement,
reallocate, if appropriate, from the default to an alternate LOA
and approve or dispute each charge as appropriate.</p>
      <p class="p List2">3) Approve the statement.</p>
      <p class="p List2">4) Upload supporting documentation in the
bank’s EAS.</p>
      <p class="p List2">5) If the CH does not reconcile and approve the
statement within 15 days after the close of the billing cycle, the
CH is locked out of the file and the BO is required to perform the
CH reconciliation/approval role. After a BO certifies a statement
on the bank’s EAS, the transaction file is locked and no
further changes to the invoice are permitted.</p>
      <p class="p List1">f. <strong class="ph b">Billing Official
Certification</strong>. Reconciling and certifying a managing
account involves the following key actions:</p>
      <p class="p List2">1) Review transactions to ensure they are legal,
proper, correct, and mission essential.</p>
      <p class="p List2">2) Ensure all supporting documentation is obtained
and correct. Billing officials should review the uploaded
transaction documentation in AXOL to confirm all transactions are
reconciled and approved for payment, receipt is verified, and all
supporting documentation is loaded in the bank’s EAS prior to
certification.</p>
      <p class="p List2">3) Ensure CH reviews have been completed
properly.</p>
      <p class="p List2">4) Ensure receipt of all accountable property has
been properly documented.</p>
      <p class="p List2">5) Final-approve their CHs’ transactions and
certify the billing statement within five business days of the
billing cycle end date.</p>
      <p class="p List2">6) For improper purchases (including unauthorized
charges made by a properly appointed CH or GPC transactions
0intended for Government use but not permitted by law, regulation,
or Component policy, such as splitting purchases), the Government
is liable to pay; however, action may be taken against the CH.</p>
      <p class="p List2">7) If BOs find a questionable or fraudulent
transaction, they should contact their A/OPC and follow the
guidance in section 6-10.</p>
      <p class="p List1">g. <strong class="ph b">Processing Credits</strong>. The <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="Appendix-EE_6-9.html#AFARS_Appendix-EE_6-9">6-9. Payments of Monthly Invoices</a> is the authoritative source of guidance related to application of credits. As stated in the FMR, transaction credits are funds sent back to DoD from the contracted bank resulting from returned items, billing errors, overpayments, duplicate payments, or erroneous payments. The <a class="xref" href="https://smartpay.gsa.gov/about/master-contract/#gsa-smartpay-3-master-contract" target="_blank">GSA SP3 Master Contract</a> defines “credit” as “any transaction that reduces the amount due to the agency/organization or account holder.” Transaction credits must be credited to the original appropriation from which they were disbursed. Transaction credits will be posted as credits against CH statements, using the default LOA at the CH statement level, and should be reallocated as appropriate if the default LOA did not incur the original expenditure. In the case where a closed account carries a credit balance, the amount will be sent via check or using ACH to an installation account predetermined by the A/OPC. Checks will be addressed to “U.S. Treasury.” The A/OPC will work with his/her RM in identifying an account and determining how the credit will be distributed across LOAs as warranted. The BO will send the check and LOA(s) to the supporting accounting office with a request to deposit.</p>
