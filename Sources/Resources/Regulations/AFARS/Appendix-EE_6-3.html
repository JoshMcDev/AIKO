      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. Effective August 13, 2020, FAR Case 2018-017
amends the FAR to implement section 889(a)(1(B) of the John S.
McCain NDAA for Fiscal Year 2019 which prohibits Federal agencies
from purchasing products or services from entities that use covered
equipment or services as a substantial or essential component of
any system, or as critical technology as part of any system,
regardless of whether that usage is in performance of work under
Federal contract. <a class="xref" href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/asda/dpc/cp/cyber/gpc.html" target="_blank">

requires recording of specific 889 designations in the bank’s

            <u class="ph u">GPC
Memorandum dated June 29, 2022</u>
          </a> provides further guidance on
completing the required fields. CHs must record 889 Designation
information in the bank’s EAS.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">889 Representation</strong>. Federal
law requires CHs to obtain a current 889 representation for each
transaction and to include the representation with their
transaction documentation. The representation contains the language
from FAR 52.204-26, Covered Telecommunications Equipment or
Services- Representation. CHs may obtain the vendor’s 889
representation by using one of the following methods:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Search for vendor on the 889 GSA Easy Search
Tool: <a class="xref" href="https://889.smartpay.gsa.gov/" target="_blank">https://889.smartpay.gsa.gov/</a>.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Use the robotic process automation (RPA) tool
to search SAM.gov. Send an email to <a class="xref" href="mailto:info@section889request.com" target="_blank">
            <u class="ph u">info@section889request.com</u>
          </a>
with the vendor’s Unique Entity ID (UEI) or Cage code in the
subject line. Do not include any text in the body of the email. The
RPA will return an email with the vendor’s FAR 52.204-26
language, if applicable.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Log into the <a class="xref" href="https://www.sam.gov/" target="_blank">
            <u class="ph u">System for Award Management
(SAM.gov) website</u>.</a> Locate the vendor’s entity
registration and review FAR 52.204-26, under Reps and Certs.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Use the vendor’s completed 889
representation form. The form must be dated and signed. Completed
forms are valid for 1 year after date of signature unless the
vendor updates their systems at which time the vendor will need to
fill out a new 889 form.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. The requirement to obtain an 889 representation
does not apply under the following conditions:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Contract payments. When the GPC is used as a
method of payment against a contract, the Contracting Officer is
responsible for ensuring compliance prior to award.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Inter/intra-governmental payments.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) SF 182 individual training payments.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Fraudulent (external) transactions.</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) Fees (e.g., convenience check fees).</p>
        <p class="p List2">6) Refunds and transaction credits/discounts.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. Pursuant to DoD policy, bank EAS entries must
indicate how the vendor’s 889 representation was obtained.
For 100% of transactions, CH must enter appropriate 889 designation
in the bank’s EAS. CHs must enter one of the allowable codes
in Table 6-2 in the following locations in the bank’s EAS, as
applicable:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) CHs creating manual orders will use the
“889 Designation” field in Order Management.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) CHs receiving editable eOrders will use the
“889 Designation” field in Order Management.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) CHs receiving non-editable eOrders will use the
“889 Designation” field in the Custom Fields tab in
Transaction Management.</p>
        <p class="p">BOs must check for bank EAS entries when reconciling. BOs and
A/OPCs must monitor 889 compliance during DM case dispositions and
should use the “Cyber Security Non-Compliance” finding
for cases without an 889 bank EAS entry once CI 193 is
implemented.</p>
