        <p class="p List1">a. Wide Area Workflow must be utilized when making
contract payments with the GPC per DFARS 232.7002, 232.7003, and
252.232-7003. The contractor must use WAWF to create the purchase
card receiving report (PCRR) when the GPC is used as a method of
payment. The CH provides the following information to the
contractor to submit PCRR into WAWF:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Vendor Identifier: Vendor/Company Name</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Payment Office: CRCARD</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Ship to:</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Inspect by:</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) Accept by:</p>
        <p class="p List2">6) Card Issuing Bank ID: 556862</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. The contractor then uses WAWF to create and
submit the PCRR. Upon notification that the goods have been
received, the Government acceptor accepts the PCRR in WAWF. The CH
verifies that acceptance has occurred in PIEE/WAWF and that the
contracting officer has approved the invoice. The CH submits the
invoice, receiving report, copy of the contract and modifications,
and a current obligation/disbursement sheet to the BO for approval.
After acceptance of the property in WAWF, data will flow to the
Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) based on the Pay
DoDAAC<em class="ph i">.</em> Indicating “CRCARD” as the payment
office prevents double obligation and data from entering the
payment process.</p>
