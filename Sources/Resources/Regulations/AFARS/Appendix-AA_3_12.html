Integrating Proposal into the Contract</h1>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">When planning the acquisition/source selection, coordinate
closely with legal counsel to select the best method to incorporate
beneficial aspects, such as the small business participation
commitment document or above-threshold performance, into the award
document. This is vital when aspects of a proposal are cited or
emphasized in the SSDD because they were identified as beneficial
to the government, especially when the aspects of the proposal
support a price premium paid by the government. The following
methods may be considered:</p>
        <p class="p">
          <strong class="ph b">Use of Attachment<em class="ph i">.</em>
          </strong>  Beneficial
aspects can be captured in a separate document attached to the
PWS/Statement of Work (SOW)/SOO which clearly defines the changes
to requirements based on specific beneficial aspects but leaves the
original PWS/SOW/SOO untouched. </p>
        <p class="p">
          <strong class="ph b">Section C PWS/ SOW/ SOO, System Specifications, Section
H – Special Contract Requirements, or
Other<em class="ph i">.</em>
          </strong> Above-threshold performance may be
captured within the PWS/SOW/SOO, System Specifications, Section H -
Special Contract Requirements, or otherwise captured in the
contract document, depending upon what is proposed. If using this
method, care must be executed not to permanently increase the
government’s requirements in future RFPs unless it is an
intentional decision on the part of the organization to do
so. </p>
        <p class="p"> <strong class="ph b">
            <em class="ph i">Best Practice:</em>
          </strong>
          <em class="ph i">Methods
other than an addendum to the PWS/SOW/SOO addendum may be preferred
due to the possibility of inadvertent inclusion in subsequent
contracts (causing requirements creep). The intent is not to
increase the government’s minimum requirements, but to hold a
particular offeror to their proposal. (The government may
later determine that the minimum requirement should include the
higher performance and include it at time of re-compete).</em>
        </p>
        <p class="p">
          <strong class="ph b">Model Contract Process.</strong> The RFP should
discuss the model contract process (if used) in Section L (or
equivalent) to ensure that offerors know that they will be
contractually bound to their proposed above-threshold performance.
Include language in the RFP describing how the government will
capture the promised above-threshold performance prior to award.
Above-threshold performance and significant strengths the
government expects to capture in the contract should be addressed
with the offerors during the discussions process.</p>
        <p class="p">When used, model contracts are typically sent to offerors prior
to closing discussions and submission of Final Proposal Revisions
(FPRs) to include the above-threshold performance that will be
captured upon contract award, thereby ensuring that all parties are
aware of what is expected of the prospective awardee. Ensure that
each offeror’s proposed above-threshold performance is
carefully and correctly incorporated into each model contract and
the final narrative is consistent with the letter to the offeror
requesting the FPR.</p>
        <p class="p">
          <strong class="ph b">Incorporation of Portions of Offeror’s Technical
Proposal by Reference. </strong>The RFP should advise
offerors that any part of their proposal can be incorporated by
reference. Only incorporate those portions of an offeror’s
technical proposal that provide benefit to the government.</p>

notification may be required IAW FAR 5.303 and AFARS 5105.303. For
