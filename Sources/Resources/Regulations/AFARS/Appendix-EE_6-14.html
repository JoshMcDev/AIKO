services up to the applicable MPT, whether recurring or
non-recurring. If recurring, the requirement is the total estimated
cost per fiscal year. Recurring services estimated to exceed the
MPT per fiscal year will be acquired through the contracting
office. Recurring services are performed at regular intervals and
have a demand that can be accurately predicted on a yearly basis.
Non-recurring services involve one-time, unpredictable, or
occasional requirements, and may be purchased with the GPC up to
the MPT whenever a requirement occurs.</p>

Labor Standards</strong>. Examples include services performed by

persons requiring knowledge of an advanced type in a field of
