            <p class="p">Evaluations shall either use separate technical/risk rating
process in the DoD Source Selection Procedures (SSP), section
3.1.2.1, and applying the descriptions in the DoD SSP Table 2A
Technical Rating Method; or the combined technical/risk rating
process in the DoD Source Selection Procedures, section 3.1.2.2,
and applying the descriptions in DoD SSP Table 3 Combined
Technical/Risk Rating Method, consider all examples in DoD SSP
Table 2A and considerations for application of risk evaluation
applicable to the definitions in DoD SSP Table 2B.</p>
            <p class="p">Data rights cannot be a factor or subfactor. However, offerors
may be granted one or more strengths related to data rights for a
give factor or subfactor. Further, the Government cannot require
the offeror to relinquish its data rights beyond Government’s
statutory entitlement. The Government may not assign a weakness or
deficiency due to a lack of proposed data rights above the minimum
statutory entitlement.</p>
            <p class="p">Strength Examples:</p>
            <p class="p">1) Delivering technical data with license rights that facilitate
future competitive procurement;</p>
            <p class="p">2) Delivering items that are available in the commercial market
that can be procured by other contractors in a future competitive
procurement (even without providing detailed technical information
on these commercially available items); and/or</p>
            <p class="p">3) Delivering a Product Support/Sustainment Strategy that
includes Government purpose rights (licensing technical data to
alternate contractors who will be able to participate in future
competitive procurements).</p>

                <u class="ph u">Evaluation Considerations</u>
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p class="p">When assessing the proposed data rights, consider the
following:</p>

            <p class="p">1. The Government is entitled to an “unlimited rights
license” or an “unrestricted rights license” to
form, fit, and function data; and data necessary for operation,
maintenance, installation, and training, other than Detailed
Manufacturing and Process Data (under DFARS 252.227-7013(b)(1) and
DFARS 252.227-7015(b)(1)). Furthermore, the Government is entitled
to an “unlimited rights” license for studies, analyses,
and test data produced for the contract (when the testing was
specified as an element of performance) that relate to
non-commercial items, components, and processes. Thus, the
Government should review and validate the offeror’s data and
software rights assertions, in coordination with the
program’s attorney advisor, to ensure that the
offeror’s proposal reflects at least the license rights to
which the Government is entitled. (Note: For more detailed
information, refer to the Army Data and Rights Guide <a class="xref" href="http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/cpic/cp/docs/Army_Data_and_Data_Rights_Guide_1st_Edition_4_Aug_2015.pdf" target="_blank">
                <u class="ph u">http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/cpic/cp/docs/Army_Data_and_Data_Rights_Guide_1st_Edition_4_Aug_2015.pdf</u>
              </a>)</p>
            <p class="p">2. Negotiate data rights while still in a competitive
environment. These negotiations will likely require the Contracting
Officer to open discussions unless the solicitation provides
another methodology. Although data rights cannot be a factor or
subfactor, discussions/negotiations can be opened to negotiate any
element of a solicitation or proposal ( see sample language for
Sections L&amp;M to incorporate data rights as a possible strength
in the evaluation). Note: Certain Associated License Rights will be
granted by standard DFARS clauses. Additional Associated License
Rights may be applicable negotiated Special License Agreement or
commercial license agreement. However, the data delivery
requirements must be specified, case-by-case, in each individual
contract, and data deliverables must be clearly identified by CLINs
and CDRLs that are traceable to the PWS. Deferring the discussion
of data deliverables will likely put the Government at a
disadvantage, however, it is an option (see DFARS 252.227-7027
Deferred Ordering of Technical Data or Computer Software). If there
are no data deliverables, the Government cannot exercise its data
rights. The data rights and data deliverables should be negotiated
at the same time. The IP Strategy should continuously be updated to
forecast future sustainment needs so Government can obtain
competitive pricing for future activities.) The negotiated rights
shall be passed down to the subcontractor(s).</p>
            <p class="p">3. Ensure the solicitation requires the proposal to include the
supporting information necessary for the Government to validate
contractor’s ability to provide any proposed data rights. For
example:</p>
            <p class="p">a. The offeror’s proposal shall demonstrate the ability to
grant license rights for technical data and computer software
necessary for depot maintenance, if applicable.</p>
            <p class="p">b. Identify the software developer/owner. Determine if the
offeror wholly owns the rights necessary to make, use, sell, or
offer them for sale. Is there a third party software
developer/owner?</p>
            <p class="p">c. Determine if the offeror proposed third-party and/or utilizes
open source software. Will any of the third-party software be open
source?</p>
            <p class="p">4. With the assistance of a cognizant IP attorney, the
Government should conduct research to verify IP and data rights
assertions made by the offeror. If the Government has reason to
believe that the offeror incorrectly asserted that an item was
developed exclusively at private expense, the Government may audit
the offeror’s accounts with the assistance of the Defense
Contracting Audit Agency (DCAA). (NOTE: The Contracting Officer
should engage with DCAA as early in the process in the procurement
planning process as possible to determine DCAA’s availability
to assist.)</p>
