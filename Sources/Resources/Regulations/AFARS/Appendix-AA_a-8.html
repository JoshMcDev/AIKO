          <p class="p"> You may request that questions from the offeror’s
personnel be funneled through their main spokesperson (this
facilitates the orderly conduct of the debriefing).</p>
          <p class="p"> As a general rule, do not answer questions “on
the fly”.</p>
          <p class="p"> Hold a government caucus to formulate a response before
providing an answer <em class="ph i">(maintain source selection materials in
caucus room for reference, if needed)</em>.</p>
          <p class="p"> Government participants should only speak when
requested by the PCO with discussions tightly controlled.</p>
          <p class="p"> Additional questions may be answered during the
debrief. DFARS Subpart 215.506-70 and DoD Source Selection
Procedures Appendix A both provide specific guidance and timeframes
for handling questions received during or following the debrief of
offerors. Note: When providing a required postaward debriefing to
successful and unsuccessful offerors, pay careful attention to the
procedures and timeframes in DFARS 215.506-70. The number of days
for these actions are in <strong class="ph b">business days</strong>, not
calendar days.</p>
          <p class="p"> The postaward debriefing is NOT considered concluded
until all criteria specified in the DFARS and DoD Source Selection
Guide has been properly met or performed.</p>
          <p class="p"> Ensure redacted SSDD is legally sufficient, as
applicable, and all actions are performed timely per DFARS and DoD
Source Selection Procedures.</p>

            </strong>
          </p>
          <p class="p"> The PCO must include a summary of each debriefing as a
record in the contract file. This post-debriefing memorandum should
include, at a minimum:</p>
          <p class="p">o A list of all debriefing attendees;</p>
          <p class="p">o A summary of the information disclosed during the debriefing.
(The most efficient means for doing this is to attach the
debriefing slides to the memorandum.);</p>
          <p class="p">o The offeror’s request for a debriefing, if any;</p>
          <p class="p">o The substance of all questions and answers discussed at, or
provided subsequent to, the debriefing. This includes previously
submitted questions, any hand-outs, and a list of written
questions/answers;</p>
          <p class="p">o Any other relevant documents.</p>
