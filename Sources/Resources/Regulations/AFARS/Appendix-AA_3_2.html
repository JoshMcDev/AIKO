          </strong>
        </p>
        <p class="p">After receipt of proposals, there are three types of exchanges
that may occur between the government and offerors --
clarifications, communications, and negotiations / discussions.
When they occur, their purpose and scope, and whether offerors are
allowed to revise their proposals as a result of the exchanges are
different for each.</p>
        <p class="p">Clarifications may only be used when an award will be made
without discussions (see FAR 15.306(a)(1) and DoD Source Selection
Procedures 3.3.1).</p>
        <p class="p">Communications (see FAR 15.306(b) and DoD Source Selection
Procedures 3.5.2) and discussions (see FAR 15.306(b) and DoD Source
Selection Procedures 3.5) are used when a competitive range will be
established. <strong class="ph b">
