         </span>See AFARS 5101.170(c) Table 5101-1 for Army level peer reviews, thresholds and approval authority. The SCO will establish a threshold for when a CRB is required for contract modifications that increase total evaluated price or otherwise increase scope. A CRB is not required for modifications that exercise an option or add incremental funding. The SRB and CRB will be comprised of senior level experts from teams not directly involved with the procurement being reviewed. These multi-functional teams will include, at a minimum, representatives from the contracting activity, small business office, office of counsel, requirements community, and the advocate for competition, as applicable. The same representatives should participate in both the SRB and the CRB to ensure consistency.</p>
      <p class="p List3">(ii) <em class="ph i">Objective of Army peer reviews.</em> The SRB/CRB will review and assess the presolicitation, solicitation and contract award documents for consistency, sufficiency, compliance and application of sound business practices. The SRB/CRB will verify that the procurement represents an overall good value to the Government and appropriate obligation of taxpayer funds.</p>
      <p class="p List3">(iii) <em class="ph i">Resolution of comments.</em> The SCO will establish procedures for resolving all SRB and CRB comments.</p>
      <p class="p List3">(iv) <em class="ph i">Peer review statistics. </em>Contracting activities will collect peer review statistics, to include annual data on the number of SRB/CRB reviews conducted and waived, identification of any systemic issues or trends, best practices, lessons learned, overall effectiveness of the process, and other data as determined necessary. </p>

                        Other Army peer reviews identified in AFARS 5101.170(b) are not required when the ODASA(P) conducts a special interest peer review for a procurement.
