      <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">DM Case Management.</strong> Oversight
Systems’ IOD DM capability evaluates each transaction against
a set of tiered business rules to identify high-risk transactions.
Tier 1 rules are mandatory and applicable to all DoD purchase
cards. Tier 2 rules are mandatory rules that can be tailored as
necessary at the local level. DM cases can be system-generated or
manually generated. The system generates a DM case whenever a
business rule is broken. GPC program officials are required to
manually create cases for each finding and disciplinary category
determination they independently identify during their reviews.
Each case is adjudicated to determine if the transaction is to be
classified under one of five disciplinary categories standardized
in compliance with the DPCAP memo “Final Governmentwide
Commercial Purchase Card Disciplinary Category Definitions
Guidance,” January 27, 2020. Disputes are also categorized as
determinations.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Tier 2 Tailoring</strong>. Tier 2
business rules are tailorable to meet the Army’s
organizational needs. Tailoring must be consistent with
requirements in the DoD Charge Card Guidebook. As part of the SAHAR
process, HAs are required to validate that any Tier 2 Tailoring of
DM business rules are implemented appropriately. For more
information, refer to GPC one-pager 3OP034, “Tier 2 Tailoring
in Insights on Demand (IOD)” on the DPCAP GPC website. To
properly manage program risk for these potentially high-risk
transactions, IOD automatically selects a random sample of 1% of
these Tier 2 “auto closed” cases and assigns them for
adjudication (“1% Random Reopen”). The IST reviews Tier
2 Tailoring data sets and trends and considers methodology changes
based on its findings.</p>
      <p class="p">c. <strong class="ph b">Case Assignment and Review Process</strong>.</p>
      <p class="p List2">1) IOD flags a transaction for review, generates a
case, and assigns it to the primary BO.</p>
      <p class="p List2">2) The BO reviews the CH’s file
documentation per section 6-2.g. The BO then locates the case in
IOD and inputs requested data.</p>
      <p class="p List2">3) After the BO submits their review, IOD assigns
the case to the Level 4 A/OPC. The Level 4 A/OPC reviews the
CH’s file documentation, inputs comments about the purchase,
identifies the applicable finding, and closes the case. The
comments should provide information about the transaction and a
detailed explanation of any findings. For administrative findings,
the comments must state what documents or signatures were
missing.</p>
      <p class="p">Tables 11-1 and 11-2 summarize the available options for
Findings, Determinations, and Corrective Actions in IOD.</p>
