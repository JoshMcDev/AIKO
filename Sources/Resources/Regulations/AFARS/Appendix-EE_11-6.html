        <p class="p">a. A/OPCs and CPMs must complete semi-annual reviews within IOD
to ensure adherence to internal controls, facilitate senior
management’s awareness of their program’s health, and
promote the interdisciplinary communication necessary for
successful GPC program operations. Semi-annual reviews will be
performed in IOD after the end of the March and September billing
cycles. They are a consolidation of the previous six monthly
reviews (20 March to 19 September and 20 September to 19 March each
year).</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">A/OPC Semi-Annual Review</strong>.
Level 4 A/OPCs must complete this review once all six prior monthly
reviews have been completed. The A/OPC reviews the internal
controls summary and inputs requested data for all applicable
agents.</p>

Level 3 A/OPCs must complete this review once all Level 4 A/OPCs
assigned to them have completed their semi-annual reviews. The
Level 3 A/OPC reviews the internal controls summary for their
program, concurs with the findings, determinations, and any
corrective actions planned or taken, and affirms that they have
briefed results to the HA.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">CPM Semi-Annual Review</strong>. CPMs
(Level 2 A/OPCs) must complete this review once all Level 3 A/OPCs

SCOs with a high-level GPC monitoring and oversight summary across
their respective GPC program. A/OPCs at each level are required to
brief their HCA and/or SCO and obtain their signature on the
report, prior to submission to the ODASA(P). See <a class="xref" href="https://armyeitaas.sharepoint-mil.us/sites/ASA-ALT-PAM-ProcProc/SitePages/GPC-SAHAR-Report-Instructions.aspx" target="_blank">Army

        <p class="p List1">f. In the event errors are identified, A/OPCs,
OA/OPCs, and CPMs should annotate corrections and explain the
error(s) encountered in the Notes field of the report (or
associated attachments) to help determine whether a system issue
requires resolution. The Notes field will also be used to address
issues and explain any exceptional circumstances (positive and
negative), so they are retained and available for future reference.
A/OPCs must attach an electronic copy of the signed report,
including all notes and associated documentation, in the Messages
tab of the Semi-Annual Checklists in IOD.</p>
        <p class="p List1">g. A/OPCs and CPMs must perform the following
actions:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Generate the Semi-Annual HA Review Report in
IOD. Include the following in the Notes section for all agents
under review: summary assessment of findings and determinations,
span of control, purchasing and behavior patterns not identified by
IOD, appropriate attestations, and any SAHAR issues or data
errors.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Brief semi-annual review results to their
HCA/SCO and summarize program strengths and concerns. Conduct the
briefing before completing the semi-annual review in IOD.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Certify completion by submitting the
semi-annual review in IOD.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Obtain the HCA/SCO’s signature on the
report.</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) Upload the signed report in the Messages tab of
