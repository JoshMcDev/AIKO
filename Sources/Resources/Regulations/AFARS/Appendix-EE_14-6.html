        <p class="p List1">a. The servicing bank provides Merchant
Authorization Controls (MAC) in the form of Merchant Category Codes
(MCC) and Merchant Category Code Groups (MCCG). MCCs and MCCGs
categorize merchants by the goods and services they provide. They
are used within the servicing bank’s card processing system
to authorize or decline purchase transactions based on controls
established for each GPC account. An MCC is a four-character
numeric code with a corresponding description that reflects the
merchant’s primary business. An MCCG is a logical grouping of
MCCs.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Merchant Category Code (MCC)</strong>.
A code assigned by the merchant’s bank to categorize each
merchant according to the type of business in which the merchant is
engaged and the kinds of supplies or services provided. These codes
are used as authorized transaction codes on a card/account to
identify the types of businesses providing authorized supplies or
services. DPCAP maintains the list of DoD-wide blocked MCC codes.
The servicing bank uses MasterCard’s MCCs to categorize
merchants based on the types of goods or services they provide.
When an A/OPC adds MCCs to a Cardholder or Managing Account
profile, it enables that specific account to make purchases from
vendors categorized under that MCC.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Tier 1 MCCs</strong>. The servicing
bank has placed a hard block on merchants with Tier 1 (Very High
Risk) MCCs. The bank will decline all attempted transactions from
vendors with these MCCs. Tier 1 MCCs may be unblocked upon approval
by the Level 2 A/OPC, on a case-by-case basis. All purchases from
merchants associated with Tier 1 MCCs will generate a data mining
case in IOD.</p>

        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Tier 2 MCCs</strong>. Tier 2 MCCs are
considered high risk, and their blocking can be customized within
the servicing bank. Level 3 A/OPCs may authorize purchase from
vendors with Tier 2 MCCs on a case- by-case basis. Purchases from
merchants associated with these MCCs will not automatically
generate a case in IOD. A complete list of Tier 1 and 2 MCCs are
located at <a class="xref" href="https://extranet.acq.osd.mil/dpap/pdi/pc/FOUO%20-%20DoD%20High-Risk%20MCC%20List_10%2028%2020.docx" target="_blank">

        <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">MCC Blocking</strong>. MCC blocking is
a designation attached to an account, which prevents a specified
MCC group from being charged (e.g., casinos, pawn shops). The
blocking is established by attaching a merchant authorization
control to a cardholder and/or managing account. If authorized MCCs
are attached and set to approve, then non-authorized MCCs are
effectively blocked. If non-authorized MCCs are attached and set to
decline, then those MCCs are blocked and all other MCCs are
effectively authorized.</p>
        <p class="p List1">f. <strong class="ph b">Requests to Override an MCC
Block</strong>. When requesting to override an MCC block, the CH or
BO must provide the following information to the A/OPC.</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Merchant name and address</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Item/service description</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Exact dollar amount of the transaction</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Estimated date of the purchase</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) CH name and last four digits of the card
account number</p>
        <p class="p List2">6) Justification for the purchase</p>
        <p class="p List2">7) Description of efforts to locate a source other
than the merchant with the blocked MCC</p>
        <p class="p List2">8) Blocked MCC, if known</p>
        <p class="p">The Level 4 A/OPC will forward the request to the appropriate
higher-level A/OPC for approval. Upon approval, the Level 4 A/OPC
will update the merchant authorization control in the CH account to
allow the transaction to process. The CH asks the vendor to
resubmit the charge. After the transaction has processed, the Level
4 A/OPC will reapply the merchant authorization control to the CH
account.</p>
        <p class="p List1">g. <strong class="ph b">Erroneous MCCs</strong>. When a GPC
transaction is declined due to an erroneously identified code, the
CH must contact the servicing bank to determine what code is
necessary to complete the transaction with the declining merchant.
The BO and CH should contact the A/OPC to discuss a change to the
CH’s merchant authorization controls. Appropriate
authorization is required when Tier 1 or Tier 2 MCC is the
concern.</p>
