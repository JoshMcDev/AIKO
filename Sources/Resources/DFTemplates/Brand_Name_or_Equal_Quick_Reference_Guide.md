## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Don't:**
- Use brand names without proper justification
- Create overly restrictive salient characteristics
- Ignore equivalent products in marketplace
- Fail to allow meaningful competition
- Accept higher costs without justification

✅ **Do:**
- Thoroughly research market alternatives
- Develop objective equivalency criteria
- Encourage competition through "or equal" provisions
- Document comprehensive technical justification
- Consider total life cycle costs and benefits

## Documentation Requirements

**Must Have:**
- Brand name necessity justification
- Market research for equivalent products
- Salient characteristics for equivalency determination
- Competition analysis and enhancement efforts
- Cost-benefit analysis supporting approach

**Should Have:**
- Technical specifications and performance requirements
- Compatibility and interface documentation
- Quality and reliability standards
- Life cycle cost analysis
- Risk assessment for alternatives

## Equivalency Determination Process

### Evaluation Methodology:
- Establish clear evaluation criteria and standards
- Develop objective testing and assessment procedures
- Define acceptable performance ranges and tolerances
- Create documentation requirements for equivalency claims

### Technical Evaluation:
- Performance testing against salient characteristics
- Quality and reliability assessment
- Compatibility and interface verification
- Environmental and operational testing

### Life Cycle Cost Analysis:
- Total cost of ownership comparison
- Acquisition, operation, and maintenance costs
- Training and support cost implications
- Risk cost assessment and mitigation

## Alternative Approaches

### When Brand Name Not Appropriate:
- **Performance Specifications:** Detailed performance-based requirements
- **Commercial Item Description:** Market-based specifications
- **Functional Requirements:** Outcome-based specifications
- **Industry Standards:** Reference to established standards

### Specification Development:
- Focus on essential functional requirements
- Use industry standards and specifications
