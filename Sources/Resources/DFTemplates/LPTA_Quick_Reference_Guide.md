- [ ] Assessed technical risks
- [ ] Coordinated with stakeholders

## Key FAR Requirements for LPTA (FAR 15.101-2)

### The Three Mandatory Conditions:
1. **Well-defined requirements** - Your PWS/SOW must have clear, objective, measurable performance standards
2. **Minimal value above threshold** - Technical superiority above minimum acceptable level provides little additional benefit
3. **Competitive market expectation** - Market research supports expectation of multiple technically acceptable proposals at competitive prices

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Don't:**
- Use LPTA for complex, innovative requirements
- Apply LPTA when technical differences have significant value
- Use subjective evaluation criteria
- Assume LPTA without proper analysis

✅ **Do:**
- Ensure requirements are truly well-defined
- Conduct thorough market research
- Document clear cost/benefit rationale
- Coordinate with all stakeholders
- Maintain supporting documentation

## Documentation Requirements

**Must Have:**
- Market research report
- Cost/benefit analysis
- Risk assessment
- Stakeholder coordination records
- Requirements documentation (PWS/SOW)

**Should Have:**
- Industry day documentation
- RFI responses
- Historical pricing data
- Technical expert input
- Legal review documentation

## Review Process

1. **Self-Review:** Complete all sections and verify supporting evidence
2. **Technical Review:** Have technical experts validate requirements and evaluation approach
3. **Legal Review:** Ensure compliance with FAR and agency policies
4. **Stakeholder Coordination:** Obtain concurrence from all required parties
5. **Final Approval:** Contracting Officer signature and date

## Post-Award Considerations

- Maintain all supporting documentation per agency retention requirements
- Be prepared to defend LPTA decision if protested
- Document lessons learned for future acquisitions
- Monitor contractor performance to validate LPTA approach effectiveness

## Template Maintenance

- Update template based on FAR changes
- Incorporate lessons learned
- Review agency-specific requirements periodically
- Validate against current best practices
