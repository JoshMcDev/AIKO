# Cost-Plus Contract Type - Quick Reference Guide

## Overview
This guide provides instructions for using the Cost-Plus Contract Type D&F template per FAR 16.3 and cost-reimbursement contract requirements.

## Pre-Template Checklist

Before using this template, ensure you have:
- [ ] Determined cost-plus is appropriate contract type
- [ ] Assessed contractor accounting systems and controls
- [ ] Established adequate Government oversight capabilities
- [ ] Defined clear performance objectives and incentives
- [ ] Verified cost allowability and allocability standards

## Key Cost-Plus Contract Requirements (FAR 16.301-3)

### When Cost-Plus Contracts Are Appropriate:
- **Uncertainties:** Substantial uncertainties in performance requirements
- **Research/Development:** Exploratory or experimental work
- **Complex Requirements:** Highly complex technical requirements
- **Emergency Situations:** Urgent requirements with uncertain scope
- **Risk Management:** High performance risk requiring flexibility

### Cost-Plus Contract Types:
1. **CPFF (Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee):** Fixed fee regardless of actual costs
2. **CPIF (Cost-Plus-Incentive-Fee):** Fee varies with cost performance
3. **CPAF (Cost-Plus-Award-Fee):** Fee based on performance evaluation
4. **CPLC (Cost-Plus-Letter Contract):** Temporary authorization pending definitive contract

## Template Completion Instructions

### Section-by-Section Guidance:

**Contract Type Justification:**
- Document uncertainties requiring cost-plus approach
- Explain why fixed-price not appropriate
- Assess risk allocation between Government and contractor
- Justify specific cost-plus type selection

**Contractor Assessment:**
- Evaluate contractor accounting systems
- Assess cost control capabilities and history
- Review contractor business systems and internal controls
- Verify adequacy of management and oversight

**Government Oversight Plan:**
- Define Government oversight and monitoring approach
- Establish cost control and performance monitoring procedures
- Plan for regular cost and schedule reviews
- Address audit and compliance requirements

## Cost-Plus Contract Type Analysis

### CPFF (Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee):
**When Appropriate:**
- Research and development work
- Uncertain scope or technical requirements
- Low to moderate performance risk
- Contractor effort level predictable

**Fee Structure:**
- Fixed fee amount negotiated at contract award
- Fee does not vary with actual costs incurred
- Provides basic profit for contractor effort
- Simple administration and payment

### CPIF (Cost-Plus-Incentive-Fee):
**When Appropriate:**
- Cost reduction incentives important
- Moderately uncertain requirements
- Contractor has cost control influence
- Performance targets establishable

**Fee Structure:**
- Minimum and maximum fee established
- Fee varies inversely with cost performance
- Share ratio for cost overruns/underruns
- Requires target cost and fee negotiation

### CPAF (Cost-Plus-Award-Fee):
**When Appropriate:**
- Performance quality critical
- Performance standards subjective
- Strong contractor motivation needed
- Government oversight capabilities adequate

**Fee Structure:**
- Base fee plus award fee pool
- Award fee based on performance evaluation
- Periodic evaluation and fee determination
- Requires detailed evaluation criteria

## Contractor Accounting System Requirements

### Adequate Accounting System Elements:
- **Cost Accounting Standards (CAS):** Compliance with applicable standards
- **Segregation:** Proper cost segregation and allocation
- **Timekeeping:** Accurate labor time recording
- **Documentation:** Adequate supporting documentation
- **Internal Controls:** Effective cost control procedures

### System Evaluation Criteria:
- DCAA accounting system audit results
- Historical cost control performance
- Management system maturity and effectiveness
- Compliance with Government cost principles
- Electronic data access and reporting capabilities

## Cost Control and Oversight

### Government Oversight Requirements:
- **DCMA/DCAA Oversight:** Defense contract audit and administration
- **Contracting Officer Representative (COR):** Technical oversight
- **Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO):** Contract administration
- **Regular Reviews:** Periodic cost and performance reviews

### Cost Control Mechanisms:
- **Cost Ceilings:** Not-to-exceed contract amounts
- **Funding Limitations:** Incremental funding approaches
- **Cost Monitoring:** Regular cost reporting and analysis
- **Performance Incentives:** Link fee to cost and performance

### Risk Management:
- Cost risk assessment and mitigation
- Performance risk identification and controls
- Contractor financial stability monitoring
- Market condition impact assessment

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Use cost-plus when requirements are well-defined
- Award without adequate contractor accounting systems
- Fail to establish proper Government oversight
- Ignore cost control and monitoring requirements
- Accept unlimited cost growth without controls

 **Do:**
- Justify uncertainties requiring cost-plus approach
- Verify adequate contractor business systems
- Establish comprehensive oversight and monitoring
- Include appropriate cost controls and ceilings
- Plan for transition to fixed-price when appropriate

## Documentation Requirements

**Must Have:**
- Contract type justification and analysis
- Contractor accounting system assessment
- Government oversight plan and procedures
- Cost control mechanisms and ceilings
- Fee structure and incentive analysis

**Should Have:**
- Market research for contract type alternatives
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Historical cost performance data
- Independent Government cost estimate
- Audit and compliance planning

## Cost Allowability and Allocability

### Cost Principles (FAR 31):
- **Allowable Costs:** Reasonable, allocable, and consistent
- **Unallowable Costs:** Specifically prohibited costs
- **Direct Costs:** Costs directly identifiable to contract
- **Indirect Costs:** Costs allocated through approved methods

### Common Cost Issues:
- **Labor Costs:** Direct and indirect labor rates
- **Material Costs:** Purchased materials and subcontracts
- **Travel Costs:** Business travel and temporary duty
- **Equipment Costs:** Use charges and depreciation
- **Facilities Costs:** Rent, utilities, and facility costs

## Contract Administration Considerations

### Payment Procedures:
- Monthly cost reimbursement requests
- Provisional payment procedures
- Fee payment schedules and triggers
- Funding limitation notifications

### Performance Monitoring:
- Technical performance measurement
- Cost performance against estimates
- Schedule adherence and milestone tracking
- Quality control and deliverable acceptance

### Contract Closeout:
- Final cost determination and audit
- Fee calculation and final payment
- Property disposition and accountability
- Lessons learned documentation

## Review Process

1. **Contract Type Justification:** Verify appropriateness of cost-plus approach
2. **Contractor Assessment:** Validate accounting systems and capabilities
3. **Oversight Planning:** Review Government monitoring and control procedures
4. **Cost Control Review:** Assess adequacy of cost control mechanisms
5. **Risk Analysis:** Evaluate risk allocation and mitigation strategies
6. **Approval Authority:** Route to appropriate approval level

## Post-Award Management

- Implement comprehensive cost and performance monitoring
- Conduct regular contractor business system reviews
- Maintain active Government oversight and surveillance
- Monitor cost trends and take corrective action as needed
- Plan for contract type transition as uncertainties resolve

## Transition Planning

**To Fixed-Price Contracts:**
- Monitor requirement stabilization
- Plan for competitive follow-on procurement
- Document lessons learned and performance data
- Transition knowledge and technical data
- Evaluate contractor capability for fixed-price work
