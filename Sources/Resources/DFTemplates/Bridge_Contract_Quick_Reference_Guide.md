# Bridge Contract - Quick Reference Guide

## Overview
This guide provides instructions for using the Bridge Contract D&F template for temporary contract solutions while transitioning between contracts.

## Pre-Template Checklist

Before using this template, ensure you have:
- [ ] Documented the gap between current and future contracts
- [ ] Verified urgent need for continuous service/supply
- [ ] Assessed duration required for permanent solution
- [ ] Confirmed no alternative solutions available
- [ ] Planned competitive strategy for permanent contract

## Key Bridge Contract Principles

### When Bridge Contracts Are Appropriate:
- **Service Continuity:** Essential services cannot be interrupted
- **Procurement Delays:** Permanent solution delayed beyond current contract
- **Transition Requirements:** Time needed for contractor changeover
- **Market Conditions:** Allow market stabilization or development

### Bridge Contract Characteristics:
- **Temporary Nature:** Short-term solution only
- **Limited Scope:** Essential requirements only
- **Higher Cost Acceptable:** Premium for continuity justified
- **Competitive Follow-on:** Permanent solution through competition

## Template Completion Instructions

### Section-by-Section Guidance:

**Gap Analysis:**
- Document specific gap between contracts
- Identify essential vs. non-essential requirements
- Assess impact of service/supply interruption
- Define minimum acceptable service levels

**Urgency Justification:**
- Explain why gap cannot be tolerated
- Document consequences of service interruption
- Assess mission impact and risks
- Justify timeline constraints

**Duration and Scope:**
- Limit to minimum time necessary
- Include only essential requirements
- Plan realistic timeline for permanent solution
- Avoid scope creep beyond bridge needs

## Bridge Contract Duration Considerations

### Typical Duration Ranges:
- **Short-term:** 30-90 days for simple requirements
- **Medium-term:** 3-6 months for complex transitions
- **Long-term:** 6-12 months for major procurements
- **Extended:** Over 12 months (requires special justification)

### Duration Factors:
- Complexity of permanent procurement
- Market development requirements
- Technical evaluation timeframes
- Contractor transition periods

### Duration Limitations:
- Should not exceed time needed for permanent solution
- Avoid creating indefinite bridge arrangements
- Plan for potential extension needs
- Consider budget and funding cycles

## Competitive vs. Sole Source Bridge Contracts

### Competitive Bridge Contracts:
**When Appropriate:**
- Multiple capable contractors available
- Time permits limited competition
- Bridge requirements suitable for competition
- Cost benefits justify competition effort

**Competitive Methods:**
- Simplified acquisition procedures
- Limited competition among qualified sources
- Existing contract vehicles (GSA, SEWP, etc.)
- Emergency competition procedures

### Sole Source Bridge Contracts:
**When Appropriate:**
- Incumbent contractor only viable option
- Technical compatibility requirements
- Urgent timeline precludes competition
- Transition complexity favors incumbent

**Justification Requirements:**
- Document why only incumbent capable
- Explain technical or operational constraints
- Justify urgency precluding competition
- Address price reasonableness despite sole source

## Pricing and Cost Considerations

### Pricing Strategies:
- **Existing Contract Rates:** Extension of current pricing
- **Market-Based Pricing:** Current market rate analysis
- **Cost-Plus Arrangements:** For uncertain bridge requirements
- **Not-to-Exceed Pricing:** Ceiling prices for cost control

### Cost Acceptability:
- Higher costs may be acceptable for continuity
- Document premium justification
- Compare with interruption costs
- Plan cost reduction for permanent contract

### Budget Considerations:
- Verify funding availability for bridge period
- Address fiscal year funding constraints
- Plan for permanent contract funding
- Document budget impact analysis

## Common Bridge Contract Scenarios

### Procurement Delays:
- Award protests delaying permanent contract
- Technical evaluation complexity
- Legal or regulatory delays
- Funding or authorization delays

### Contractor Transitions:
- Incumbent contractor departure
- New contractor mobilization time
- Knowledge transfer requirements
- System or facility transitions

### Market Development:
- Insufficient competition for permanent contract
- New technology adoption periods
- Industry capacity development
- Small business market development

### Emergency Situations:
- Natural disaster response
- Security threat response
- System failure recovery
- Regulatory compliance requirements

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Don't:**
- Use bridge contracts as indefinite solutions
- Include non-essential requirements in bridge scope
- Fail to plan competitive permanent solution
- Accept unreasonable pricing without justification
- Allow repeated bridge contract extensions

✅ **Do:**
- Limit duration to minimum necessary time
- Include only essential requirements
- Plan competitive strategy from start
- Document comprehensive justification
- Monitor progress toward permanent solution

## Documentation Requirements

**Must Have:**
- Gap analysis and service continuity needs
- Duration justification and timeline
- Scope limitation to essential requirements
- Pricing analysis and reasonableness determination
- Competitive strategy for permanent contract

**Should Have:**
- Market research for bridge and permanent solutions
- Risk assessment for service interruption
- Alternative solution analysis
- Stakeholder impact assessment
- Transition planning documentation

## Alternative Solutions Analysis

### Before Deciding on Bridge Contract:
- **Contract Extensions:** Extend existing contract if possible
- **Option Exercises:** Use existing contract options
- **Interim Solutions:** Alternative service providers
- **Service Reduction:** Operate with reduced services temporarily

### Decision Factors:
- Existing contract terms and authorities
- Contractor willingness and capability
- Service criticality and impact
- Cost and timeline considerations

## Review Process

1. **Gap Verification:** Confirm actual gap exists and timing
2. **Necessity Assessment:** Validate need for continuous service
3. **Duration Review:** Ensure minimum necessary timeframe
4. **Scope Limitation:** Verify essential requirements only
5. **Competition Planning:** Confirm permanent solution strategy
6. **Approval Authority:** Route to appropriate approval level

## Post-Award Management

- Monitor bridge contractor performance closely
- Track progress toward permanent solution
- Manage scope to prevent expansion beyond essential needs
- Prepare for transition to permanent contractor
- Document lessons learned for future bridge situations

## Regulatory and Policy Considerations

**Competition Requirements:** Address competition exceptions appropriately
**Small Business Goals:** Consider small business participation opportunities
**Fiscal Law:** Ensure compliance with appropriation and anti-deficiency requirements
**Agency Policy:** Follow agency-specific bridge contract procedures
