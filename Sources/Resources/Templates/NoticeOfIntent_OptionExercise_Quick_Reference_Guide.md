# NOTICE OF INTENT TO EXERCISE OPTION - QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE

## PURPOSE
A Notice of Intent (NOI) letter formally notifies the contractor of the Government's preliminary intent to exercise a contract option, allowing them time to prepare while protecting the Government's interests.

## WHEN TO USE
- **Timing:** Send 30-60 days before intended option exercise date
- **Required When:** Contract includes option periods under FAR 52.217-9
- **Best Practice:** Send as soon as intent is reasonably certain

## KEY REGULATORY REFERENCES
- **FAR 17.207** - Exercise of Options
- **FAR 52.217-9** - Option to Extend the Term of the Contract
- **FAR 42.1501** - General (Contractor Performance Information)

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS

### 1. **Clear Statement of Intent**
- Explicitly state this is a "preliminary notice of intent"
- Emphasize non-binding nature
- Clarify no work authorization until modification

### 2. **Option Details**
- Option period number
- Period of performance dates
- Option value
- Pricing structure

### 3. **Conditions Precedent**
- Funding availability
- Satisfactory performance
- Active registrations
- No defaults

### 4. **Required Contractor Actions**
- Written acknowledgment
- Updated certifications
- SAM.gov verification
- Key personnel confirmation

### 5. **Response Timeline**
- Acknowledgment: 5 business days
- Full response: 15-30 days typical

## TIMING CONSIDERATIONS

### Recommended Timeline:
```
T-60 days: Internal decision to exercise option
T-45 days: Send Notice of Intent
T-40 days: Receive contractor acknowledgment
T-30 days: Receive contractor's full response
T-15 days: Process option modification
T-0:       Option exercise effective date
```

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. **Binding Language:** Never use language that could be construed as exercising the option
2. **Work Authorization:** Don't authorize any option period work
3. **Unconditional Commitment:** Always include conditions precedent
4. **Missing Deadlines:** Ensure notice meets contract timing requirements
5. **Informal Notice:** Always use official letterhead and proper routing

## TEMPLATE VARIABLES GLOSSARY

- **{{OPTION_NUMBER}}** - Sequential option period (1, 2, 3, etc.)

- **{{INTENDED_EXERCISE_DATE}}** - Target date for modification
- **{{RESPONSE_DUE_DATE}}** - Typically 15-30 days from NOI date

## COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS

### Internal Coordination:
- **Program Office:** Confirm continued need

- **Small Business:** Subcontracting compliance

- **Contractor PM:** Heads up before formal notice
- **Key Subcontractors:** May need separate coordination
- **Customer/Requiring Activity:** Confirm requirements unchanged

## RISK MITIGATION

### Common Risks:
1. **Funding Delays:** Include funding contingency language
2. **Performance Issues:** Address in separate correspondence first
3. **Pricing Disputes:** Resolve before sending NOI
4. **Registration Lapses:** Verify SAM.gov status first
5. **Key Personnel Loss:** Address availability upfront

### Protective Measures:
- Always state "subject to" conditions
- Never guarantee option exercise
- Maintain Government's unilateral right
- Document all communications
- Keep option decision flexible

**Remember:** The NOI is a courtesy notice that protects both parties' interests. It is NOT the official option exercise, which requires a formal modification.
