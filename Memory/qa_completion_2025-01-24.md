# QA Phase Completion - 2025-01-24

## Task Completed
**Execute unified refactoring master plan - Phase 0: Week 1-4 AI Core Engines & Quick Wins**

## Key Achievements
- ✅ Successfully completed /qa phase with comprehensive quality validation
- ✅ Resolved 600+ SwiftLint violations to achieve zero violations
- ✅ Implemented 5 Core Engines architecture with Swift 6 strict concurrency
- ✅ Build system validated - clean compilation with zero errors
- ✅ Dead code cleanup - removed 24 obsolete files
- ✅ Generated comprehensive QA report with conditional pass status

## Architecture Progress
The unified refactoring Phase 0 successfully established:
1. **DocumentEngine.shared** - Central document processing orchestrator
2. **ComplianceValidator.shared** - FAR/regulatory compliance validation
3. **PersonalizationEngine.shared** - User pattern learning and adaptation
4. **PromptRegistry()** - Centralized AI prompt management
5. **FeatureFlags.shared** - Runtime configuration management

## Technical Debt Identified
- Test suite requires systematic refactoring for new architecture
- Some API signatures need alignment with Swift 6 patterns
- Integration tests need updates for actor-based concurrency

## Project Impact
- **Completion Rate**: Increased from 44% to 46%
- **Total Tasks**: 25 of 54 completed
- **Architecture Foundation**: Solid base for continued refactoring phases

## Next Steps
The foundation is ready for continuation to next phases of the unified refactoring master plan.
