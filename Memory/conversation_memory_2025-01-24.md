# AIKO Refactoring Conversation Memory
**Date**: 2025-01-24
**Session Summary**: Comprehensive analysis and refactoring planning for AIKO project

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Project Analysis
- Analyzed AIKO codebase structure: 43% complete project, TCA architecture, 40+ AI service files
- Identified project state: Swift 5, 5 SPM targets needing consolidation, partial Swift 6 compliance
- Found two AIKO projects: old at /Users/J/aiko and new at /Users/J/aiko_new

### 2. Initial Refactoring PRD
- Created 10-week refactoring plan focused on:
  - TCA → Pure SwiftUI migration
  - Target consolidation (5 → 2-3 targets)
  - Swift 6 strict concurrency compliance
  - GraphRAG implementation

### 3. VanillaIce Consensus Enhancement
- Used /vanillaice for consensus building
- Extended timeline from 10 → 12 weeks based on AI recommendations
- Added hybrid migration approach and risk mitigation strategies
- Created enhanced PRD with phased implementation

### 4. AI Services Analysis
- Analyzed 40+ AI service files in /aiko/Services folder
- User questioned if services could be removed since users provide API keys
- VanillaIce consensus: Services ARE the product - provide government contracting domain expertise
- Services include specialized prompts, compliance validation, template management
- Not just API passthrough - essential domain intelligence

### 5. AI Services Refactoring Plan
- Created plan to consolidate 40+ files → 15-20 files
- Designed 5 Core Engines Architecture:
  1. PromptEngine - Centralized prompt management
  2. DocumentEngine - Generation and processing
  3. ComplianceEngine - Validation and regulations
  4. PersonalizationEngine - User-specific adaptations
  5. AIOrchestrator - Unified coordination

### 6. Unified Master Plan
- Used VanillaIce ULTRATHINK to combine both refactoring plans
- Key insight: AI refactoring should enable, not follow UI modernization
- Created 12-week unified strategy with parallel tracks:
  - Weeks 1-6: AI consolidation enables UI work
  - Weeks 5-12: UI modernization builds on stable AI core
  - Quick wins in weeks 1-4 for early value delivery

### 7. Documentation Updates
- Saved unified_refactoring_master_plan.md to /Users/J/aiko/ project root
- Updated Project_Tasks.md with:
  - Fixed critical syntax errors (marked as completed)
  - Added unified refactoring initiative as completed task
  - Added new Phase 0 task for executing the master plan
  - Updated completion statistics (44%, 24 completed tasks)

## Key Files Created/Modified

1. `/Users/J/aiko_new/refactoring_prd.md` - Initial 10-week plan
2. `/Users/J/aiko_new/refactoring_prd_enhanced.md` - Enhanced 12-week plan with consensus
3. `/Users/J/aiko_new/ai_services_refactoring_plan.md` - AI consolidation strategy
4. `/Users/J/aiko/unified_refactoring_master_plan.md` - Master unified strategy
5. `/Users/J/aiko/Project_Tasks.md` - Updated with new tasks and completions

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **AI Services Retention**: Confirmed services provide essential domain value beyond API passthrough
2. **Parallel Execution**: AI and UI refactoring run in parallel with shared governance
3. **Quick Wins Strategy**: Early deliverables in weeks 1-4 to demonstrate value
4. **Feature Flag Approach**: Gradual rollout with safety mechanisms
5. **5 Core Engines**: Clear architectural pattern for AI consolidation

## Next Steps

Execute the unified refactoring master plan starting with:
1. Week 1-2: Set up feature flags and quick win implementations
2. Week 1-4: Begin AI Core 5 Engines architecture
3. Monitor progress against defined milestones
4. Adjust timeline based on actual velocity

## User Preferences Noted

- Values comprehensive analysis before action
- Prefers consensus-based decision making via /vanillaice
