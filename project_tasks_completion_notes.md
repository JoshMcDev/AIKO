# AIKO Project Task Completion Notes

## January 19, 2025 - Triple Architecture Migration Progress

### Completed Migrations

#### VoiceRecordingService Migration ✅
- **File**: Sources/Services/VoiceRecordingService.swift
- **Platform Conditionals**: 7 removed
- **Created Files**:
  - Sources/AppCore/Services/VoiceRecordingProtocol.swift
  - Sources/AIKOiOS/Dependencies/iOSVoiceRecordingClient.swift
  - Sources/AIKOmacOS/Dependencies/macOSVoiceRecordingClient.swift
- **Approach**: 
  - Created protocol and client struct in AppCore
  - Implemented platform-specific clients using Speech framework for iOS
  - Basic recording implementation for macOS without Speech framework
  - Registered dependencies in platform modules
  - Deleted original service file

#### HapticManager Migration ✅
- **File**: Sources/Core/Services/HapticManager.swift
- **Platform Conditionals**: 5 removed
- **Created Files**:
  - Sources/AppCore/Services/HapticManagerProtocol.swift
  - Sources/AppCore/ViewModifiers/HapticModifiers.swift
  - Sources/AIKOiOS/Dependencies/iOSHapticManagerClient.swift
  - Sources/AIKOmacOS/Dependencies/macOSHapticManagerClient.swift
- **Approach**:
  - Created protocol and client struct with @MainActor closures
  - iOS implementation uses UIKit haptic generators
  - macOS implementation uses CoreHaptics patterns
  - Created view modifiers that use dependency injection
  - Need to update views that use HapticManager.shared

### Attempted but Skipped

#### DocumentParserEnhanced Migration ❌
- **File**: Sources/Services/DocumentParserEnhanced.swift
- **Platform Conditionals**: 5
- **Issue**: Complex dependencies on DocumentParser, DocumentParserValidator, WordDocumentParser, and DataExtractor
- **Decision**: Skip for now, needs refactoring of dependent services first

### Next Steps

1. **Fix HapticManager References** (8 views need updates)
   - EnhancedAppView.swift (8 conditionals)
   - Replace HapticManager.shared with @Dependency(\.hapticManager)

2. **High-Impact Files to Migrate Next**:
   - AppView.swift (23 conditionals) - Already migrated by agent
   - Views with platform conditionals need to be split into iOS/macOS modules
   - Services that can be migrated independently

3. **Build Issues to Resolve**:
   - Fix remaining HapticManager references
   - Ensure all dependencies are properly registered
   - Run full build to catch any remaining issues

### Statistics
- Total Platform Conditionals: 153
- Migrated: 14 (9.2%)
- Remaining: 139
- Files with Conditionals: 47 → ~45

### Additional Updates Completed
- Fixed all HapticManager.shared references to use @Dependency(\.hapticManager)
  - EnhancedAppView.swift: Updated property and all method calls
  - EnhancedCard.swift: Added dependency injection
  - VisualEffects.swift: Updated FloatingActionButton
- Fixed voiceRecordingService to voiceRecordingClient references
  - DocumentAnalysisFeature.swift
  - AcquisitionChatFeature.swift
- Fixed NavigationView errors by adding SwiftUI namespace prefix
  - DocumentScannerView.swift
  - iOSAppView.swift
- Fixed DocumentMetadata type mismatch
  - DocumentScannerView.swift: Changed to use AppCore.DocumentMetadata with fully qualified enum path
- Fixed ProfileImagePicker naming conflict
  - iOSMenuView.swift: Renamed to iOSProfileImagePicker
- Fixed HapticManager.shared references in test files
  - UI_EnhancementTests.swift: Replaced with interaction tests
- Fixed hapticManager scope errors in closures
  - EnhancedAppView.swift: Added local hapticManager capture in WithViewStore closure
- Fixed remaining hapticManager errors in EnhancedAppView.swift
  - Added @Dependency(\.hapticManager) to EnhancedDocumentGenerationView
  - Added @Dependency(\.hapticManager) to EnhancedDocumentCategoryCard
  - Added @Dependency(\.hapticManager) to EnhancedMenuView
  - Removed incorrect hapticManager capture from EnhancedDocumentGenerationView body

### Lessons Learned
1. Services with complex internal dependencies should be migrated together
2. View modifiers need special handling for @MainActor requirements
3. Platform-specific UI frameworks (UIKit/AppKit) need careful abstraction
4. Start with independent services before tackling interconnected ones
5. @Dependency properties need local capture when used inside closures in SwiftUI Views
